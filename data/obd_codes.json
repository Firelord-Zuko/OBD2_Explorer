Generally, diagnosing and fixing this DTC will involve inspecting the timing chains and tensioners for excessive wear or misalignment, and inspecting the crank reluctor wheel for proper positioning. Then replacing parts as required. As said earlier, there are known issues with some GM engines so there may be updated or revised replacement parts.

    "Meaning": "P0009 Engine Positions System Performance Bank 2",
    "Common Causes": "The Engine Control Module (ECM) tests for misalignment between both camshafts on one bank of the engine & the crankshaft.  The misalignment would be at an idler sprocket for either bank or at the crankshaft.  Once the ECM learns the position of both camshafts on one bank of the engine, the ECM compares the learned values to a reference value.  The ECM will set a DTC if both learned values for one bank of the engine are exceeding a calibrated threshold in the same direction.\n\nThe code is more common in the following makes: Suzuki, GM, Cadillac, Buick, Holden. In fact, there are service bulletins for certain GM vehicles and the fix is to replace timing chains (including such engines as 3.6 LY7, 3.6 LLT or 2.8 LP1). You may also see this DTC in a vehicle that also has other related DTCs such as P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018, and P0019. Bank 2 refers to the side of the engine that doesn't contains cylinder #1. Most likely you will not see just this code, you will also have a P0008 code set at the same time.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0009 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nRoughness while accelerating\nPoor fuel economy\nDecreased power\nTiming chain \"noise\"\n\nPotential Causes\nPotential causes of a P0009 code may include:\n\nStretched timing chain\nCrankshaft reluctor wheel has moved and is no longer referenced to top dead center (TDC)\nTiming chain tensioner problem\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf your vehicle is new enough that it still has powertrain warranty left, by all means let the dealer perform the fix. Generally, diagnosing and fixing this DTC will involve inspecting the timing chains and tensioners for excessive wear or misalignment, and inspecting the crank reluctor wheel for proper positioning. Then replacing parts as required. As said earlier, there are known issues with some GM engines so there may be updated or revised replacement parts.

The high control circuit carries a 12 volt pulse width modulated (PWM) signal from the PCM to the CMP actuator solenoid in order to control the amount of engine oil flow to the cam phaser.

You should use a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM) and measure the resistance of the terminals on the camshaft oil control valve (OCV). Refer to the factory spec on the reading, if it's not good, replace the OCV assembly. Also use the DVOM to verify wiring, connectors, etc. leading from the OCV back to the PCM.\nOther camshaft DTC codes: P0011 - P0012 - P0020 - P0021 - P0022\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nNeed Help - P0013 and P0014 on 2010 Chevy EquinoxHey guys, new member here.\n\nMy wife's 2010 equinox was throwing a \"P0013 - B Camshaft Position Actuator Circuit / Open Bank 1\" code.

Since the actuators work on oil pressure, the proper amount of oil is critical to ensure  proper operation of the VVT system.  Dirty or contaminated fluid may cause buildup which can  lead to failure of the control solenoid or the camshaft actuator.\nControl solenoid - The control solenoid for the camshaft can be checked for continuity using  a Digital volt/ohm meter (DVOM) using the ohms function, by unplugging the solenoid wiring  harness connector and checking the resistance of the solenoid with the (+) and (-) leads of  the DVOM on each terminal.  Ensure the internal resistance is within manufacturers  specifications if available.  If resistance is within specifications, remove the control  solenoid to verify it is not contaminated, or if there is damage to the sealing O rings to  cause a loss of oil pressure.\nCamshaft actuator - The camshaft actuator is a mechanical device controlled by internal  spring pressure and adjusted by oil supplied by the control solenoid.  When no oil pressure  is supplied, it will default to a \"safe\" position.  Refer to the manufacturers suggested  procedure to remove the camshaft actuator from the engine's camshaft to ensure no leaks are  present that would cause a loss of oil pressure to and from the actuator's hydraulic  supply/return feed lines or within the actuator itself.  Check timing chain/belt and  components to ensure they are in proper working order and installed in the correct position  on the camshaft gear.\nECM/PCM - The ECM/PCM commands the control solenoid using a Pulse width modulated signal  (PWM) to regulate the amount of on/off time, resulting in a control of the pressure used to  move the camshaft actuator.  A graphing multimeter or oscilloscope tool is required to view  the PWM signal to ensure proper operation of the ECM/PCM.  To check the PWM signal, the  positive (+) lead is tapped into the ground side of the control solenoid ( if supplied by  constant voltage, ground controlled ) or the powered side of the control solenoid (if  permanently grounded, positive control ) and the negative (-) lead is attached to a good  known ground.  If the PWM signal is not consistent with changes in engine RPM, there may be a  problem with the ECM/PCM.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2007 Hyundai Santa Fe p0026, p2189, p2187, moreI have a 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe that are reading the following codes and I have no idea of where to look to see where I can change these parts myself.

    "Meaning": "P0030 HO2S Heater Control Circuit B1S1",
    "Common Causes": "This information is then relayed to the ECM. The ECM uses this information to adjust the fuel delivered to the engine. A Heated Oxygen sensor contains a circuit dedicated to operating a heater that warms up the Oxygen sensor faster than the exhaust gasses could. This shortens the time the engine needs to achieve closed loop, which decreases emissions.\nOn some vehicles the O2 sensor heater is fed a 12V fused supply voltage and a computer controlled ground. The 12V supply voltage is supplied to the heater anytime the key is in the on position. The computer activates the heater under certain circumstances by completing the ground to the oxygen sensor heater. On other vehicles the O2 sensor heater may be supplied a computer controlled 12 volts feed and continuous ground. If the ECM detects a fault on the Bank 1, sensor 1 heater circuit a P0030 may set.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0030 DTC may include:\n\nLengthened time needed to achieve closed loop\nMIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nPossibly decreased fuel mileage depending on fault\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0030 trouble code may include:\n\nFailed or damaged heater circuit element inside the HO2S\nOpen on the O2 sensor heater's ground circuit\nOpen or short on O2 sensor heater's B+ battery feed (on some vehicles this may be the control circuit)\nPossible ECM failure (less likely)\n\nPossible Solutions\nMany times a HO2 sensors heater element may go bad due to age or impact. Keep this in mind when making your inspection. Make a visual inspection of the Bank 1,1 O2 sensor. Repair any damaged wiring from contact with exhaust.\nIf HO2 Sensor itself appears to have been damaged, replace it. If a visual inspection reveals no obvious problems, viewing the faulty heater circuit on a scan tool may reveal if the fault is currently occurring. If the scan tool datastream shows that the Bank 1,1 heater element is pulling 0 amps then suspect an open in the circuit. Check for blown fuses and then disconnect the O2 sensor connector.\nWith key on engine off use a voltmeter to check for 12 volts fused battery feed to the heater element. If there is no voltage present, repair open or short in the B+ feed circuit remembering to replace any fuse blown from the short. If the B+ battery feed is intact, remove the ground (control) circuit from the ECM wiring connector and check for resistance on the circuit. If there is infinite resistance, repair open in the circuit. If the control circuit checks out, suspect a bad O2 sensor. Replace and re-check.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2004 Malibu LT Maxx V6 3.5L - P0030 (Heater circuit HO2S Bank 1 Sensor 1)Engine codes P0135 (HO2S Performance Bank 1 Sensor 1) and P0030 (HO2S Heater circuit Bank 1 Sensor 1).\n\nI replaced the upstream oxygen sensor (bank 1 sensor 1) with an NGK 21546 however the MIL is still on.

    "Meaning": "P0033 Turbo Charger Bypass Valve Control Circuit",
    "Common Causes": "If this code has been stored it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has received an input signal from the turbocharger bypass valve control circuit that is not within programmed specifications. \nThe turbocharger bypass valve is usually controlled by the PCM or boost controller. The boost controller is sometimes a stand-alone controller but more frequently it is an integrated part of the PCM. Input data from various turbocharger and engine control sensors is calculated by the PCM to determine the desired position of the turbocharger bypass valve. The turbocharger bypass valve is used to (electronically) regulate boost pressure before it enters the engine intake manifold. \nThe bypass control valve is actuated using a small electronic motor (or vacuum control valve). The motor receives output voltage/ground signals from the boost controller or PCM. The signal wire of the turbo boost control circuit enables the PCM to monitor system voltage. If voltage is not within a predetermined range, the PCM detects it and this code is stored. A service/check engine lamp may also be illuminated.\nSince the conditions for causing this code to be stored could lead to excessive turbocharger boost pressure, it should be addressed with some degree of urgency.\n\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0033 engine code may include:\n\nReduced engine performance\nWhining or rattling noises from the turbocharger or turbo pipes\nExcessive smoke from the exhaust\n Fouled spark plugs\n Elevated engine and/or transmission temperature\nAbnormal hissing noises from the turbocharger wastegate and/or hoses\nAdditional codes may also be stored, including turbocharger boost related codes, engine misfire codes, or knock sensor codes\nDue to elevated engine temperatures, cylinder detonation is also a distinct possibility\nIf applicable, the boost pressure gauge may also exhibit abnormal levels of boost pressure.\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n\n Bad turbocharger bypass valve actuator\nDefective turbocharger bypass valve\nDisconnected, cracked, or collapsed vacuum line (vacuum actuated bypass valve)\nFaulty boost pressure sensor\n Shorted or open wiring in the boost sensor circuit\n Loose, corroded, or disconnected electrical connectors in the boost sensor reference circuit\nDefective PCM or boost controller.\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nFactory turbocharger boost pressure usually ranges between nine and fourteen pounds but check manufacturer\u2019s specifications for your vehicle. Test boost pressure to make sure that it is sufficient. If boost pressure is low, internal turbocharger repair or turbocharger replacement may be necessary. Also check turbo hoses and exhaust components for leakage.\nThere are two basic designs of turbo boost control valves. In the first design, the valve is actuated using engine vacuum. An electronically controlled vacuum control valve provides vacuum to open the boost control valve, which is closed after vacuum is restricted. Typically, the vacuum control valve (or solenoid) is supplied with battery voltage and the PCM (or boost controller) provides a ground signal when applicable.  In this type of system, engine vacuum must be checked prior to testing system electrical circuitry, components, and connectors. You may quick check the boost control valve using a hand-held vacuum pump. Simply apply vacuum directly to the valve and check operation.\nThe other turbo boost pressure control valve design utilizes an electronic valve. The valve receives a voltage signal from the PCM (or boost controller) when applicable. The voltage signal causes the valve to open and close proportionally as required to maintain optimum boost pressure. \n\nProfessional technicians report that the boost control valve is often condemned in error, when the boost pressure sensor is the defective part\n Using a digital volt/ohmmeter, test system circuit voltage and continuity to ensure that it is within manufacturer\u2019s specifications. A system wiring diagram or manufacturer\u2019s service manual (with diagnostic flow charts) will be required\nDisconnect system components and controllers prior to testing circuit continuity to prevent damage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2008 Mazda 3 multi codes (P0167, P0033, P0100, P0169)Hello, \nI have a mazda 3 2008 110ch 1.6di turbo.\nMy car was ok but problem for 2 weeks.\nMy car start normally, the engine idle power holds well but if i accelerate, the engine stalls and cuts itself off.

This electronically controlled valve is designed to relieve excessive turbocharger boost pressure. This code, in particular, indicates that a high boost condition or high boost pressure bypass valve circuit voltage has been detected.\nWhile the boost controller is occasionally a stand-alone module, it is more frequently an integrated part of the PCM. The purpose of the turbocharger boost controller (as the name implies) is intended to calculate input data from various engine and transmission sensors and use the calculations to determine how much boost pressure is required for the engine to perform at optimum levels at any given time or circumstance. The boost pressure control valve is then opened or closed as commanded by the PCM.

Nevertheless, there a few manufacturers that still utilize use a vacuum operated valve. Electronic valves are controlled directly by a voltage signal from the PCM; vacuum actuated valves are controlled using a vacuum control (or vacuum service) solenoid. The vacuum service solenoid is typically supplied with constant engine vacuum.

  "P0036": {
    "Meaning": "P0036 Heated Oxygen Sensor Control Circuit B1S2",
    "Common Causes": "The oxygen sensors used a heated circuit to warm up the sensor for faster feedback operation.  The oxygen sensor may use three or four wires depending on the vehicle, two are usually used for the sensor feedback to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) / Engine Control Module (ECM) and the other wires are for the heater to power the heated circuit.  Three wire sensors are usually grounded through the exhaust system, and four wire sensors have a seperate ground wire.\nThe P0036 code refers to the sensor after the catalytic converter on bank 1, which is on the side of the engine with the #1 cylinder.  The heater circuit may be supplied power or ground by the PCM/ECM or another source that can be controlled by the PCM/ECM.\nNote: Be careful not to work around an exhaust system that has been ran recently as they can become very hot.   This code is similar to P0030 and basically identical to P0056.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0036 DTC includes MIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination. You will probably not notice anyother symptoms associated with the failure of the heated circuit since it only runs momentarily when the vehicle is first started.  This sensor is also after the catalytic converter, so it will not affect the air/fuel ratio input to the PCM/ECM; it is primarily used to verify the catalytic converters efficiency.\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0036 trouble code may include:\n\nOpen circuit inside oxygen sensor or open power or ground wires to oxygen sensor\nExhaust system ground strap may have become corroded or broken\nPCM/ECM or oxygen sensor heater circuit wiring has failed\n\nPossible Solutions\nVisually inspect the oxygen sensor wiring for damaged or loose wiring to the sensor.\nUnplug the oxygen sensor and using a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM) set to the ohms scale, test the resistance of the heater circuit using a wiring diagram for reference.  The heater circuit inside the sensor should have some resistance present, excessive resistance or an over limit reading would indicate an open in the heated portion of the circuit and the oxygen sensor will need to be replaced. \nBack-probe the ground wire at the connector and check for resistance between a good known ground and the connector to the oxygen sensor. \nBack-probe the power supply wire at the connector with the DVOM set to DC volts with the positive lead on the power supply wire and the negative lead at a good known ground to check for power to supply at the oxygen sensor.  If no power is present at the connector during initial car startup (cold start), there may be a problem with the power supply circuit to the oxygen sensor or the PCM itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n02 BMW 330i P0444, P0056, P0505, P0036, P0102, P0500So this is my first post of this nature so give me some credit :)   I have a 2002 bmw 330i and as of yesterday evening have no power.

The PCM continuously monitors the heater circuits for abnormal voltages or in some cases, even amperages. Depending on the make of vehicle, the Oxygen sensor heater is controlled one of two ways. One way is that the PCM directly controls the voltage feed to the heater either directly or via a HO2S relay and a ground is supplied from the vehicle's common ground.

While in pre-OBD II vehicles an Oxygen sensor was a one wire sensor, now they are more commonly 4 wire sensors: Two dedicated to the oxygen sensor and two dedicated to the heater element.

  "P0039": {
    "Meaning": "P0039 Turbo Charger Bypass Valve Control Circuit Range Performance",
    "Common Causes": "A code P0039 Turbo/Super Charger Bypass Valve Control Circuit Range/Performance is stored in turbocharged and supercharged vehicles when the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a turbocharger or supercharger boost pressure bypass valve control circuit malfunction. A service engine soon lamp may also be illuminated. If this code is exhibited in a vehicle that is not turbocharged or supercharged, suspect a PCM programming error.\nThe boost pressure bypass valve is an electronically controlled valve that is constructed to relieve turbo/supercharger boost pressure before it exceeds the manufacturer\u2019s specified limit (usually between nine and fourteen-pounds). This is necessary in order to relieve potentially harmful (to the engine) boost pressure levels in the event of a turbo/supercharger malfunction.  The boost pressure bypass valve is controlled by the powertrain control module (PCM) or a separate boost pressure control module. More often than not, the boost controller is an integrated part of the PCM. The boost controller gathers input signals from various engine sensors and uses them to calculate the optimum degree of turbo/supercharger boost pressure. The boost pressure bypass valve is then activated, using an electronic solenoid, electric motor, or vacuum control valve to achieve the desired amount of boost pressure. If the boost pressure sensor delivers an input signal to the PCM that indicates an inability to successfully control boost pressure, this code will be stored. Additionally, if the PCM detects an input voltage signal that is not within programmed limits, for a specified amount of time and under certain circumstances, a P0039 Turbo/Supercharger Bypass Valve Control Circuit Range/Performance code may be stored.\nTurbo/supercharger bypass control valve operation is normally accomplished using a solenoid or a small electric motor. Vacuum operated valves are used on some models but this is design is much less common. The PCM supplies a direct voltage signal in order to activate electronically controlled valves but vacuum actuated valves are controlled using a vacuum control (or vacuum service) solenoid. The vacuum service solenoid is usually supplied with constant voltage and the PCM outputs a ground signal when the valve must be opened to relieve boost pressure. The valve closes automatically when the ground signal is stopped by the PCM. The vacuum actuated bypass valve is controlled using a voltage signal from the PCM applied to a vacuum service solenoid. Opening and closing the solenoid permits engine vacuum to the reach the valve (as required) to actuate opening. Consult the manufacturer\u2019s service manual (or equivalent) for turbo/supercharger bypass control system specifications before beginning a diagnosis. \n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nThe conditions for causing this code to be stored can lead to major engine damage from excessive turbocharger boost pressure; therefore this code should be treated urgently.\nSymptoms of a P0039 engine code may include:\n\n A significant reduction in engine performance \n Hissing noises from the turbocharger (and/or hoses) or the supercharger \n Engine and/or transmission temperatures could be higher than normal \n Excessive exhaust system smoke \n Spark plug fouling \n Cylinder detonation, caused by hotter engine temps, are also a possibility\n Other turbocharger boost related codes, engine misfire codes, or knock sensor codes may also be stored \n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code include:\n\n A shorted/open circuit in the turbocharger bypass control sensor circuit    \n The most common cause of a stored P0039 turbo/supercharger bypass valve control circuit range/performance code is probably a defective boost pressure sensor  \n A defective turbo/supercharger bypass valve actuator  \n Turbo/supercharger bypass valve failure is also fairly common \n Collapsed, disconnected, or split vacuum lines are a possibility (where a vacuum actuated bypass valve is used)  \n Loose, corroded, or disconnected electrical wiring/connectors in the turbo/supercharger bypass control/boost pressure sensor reference circuit \nA bad PCM or boost controller\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nPursuant to maintaining an acceptable degree of turbo/supercharger boost pressure, the boost pressure bypass control valve is designed to open and close to a calculated degree (via an electrical signal from the PCM). The desired position of the valve is one which will afford maximum engine performance and efficiency, while avoiding potentially harmful (to the engine) boost levels.\nWhen diagnosing a P0039 turbo/supercharger bypass valve control circuit range/performance code, I would likely begin with an inspection of all wiring and vacuum hoses related to the turbo/supercharger and boost control system. I would also include an inspection of the battery, battery cables, and battery cable ends. \nProceed by retrieving and making note of all stored trouble codes and freeze-frame data (if available). Clear all stored diagnostic trouble codes from the system using a code reader or scanner. You may determine that the code is intermittent if it fails to reset. Intermittent codes can be even more difficult to diagnose. When this type of code is stored, some OBD-II systems will put the boost pressure bypass valve in the wide-open position. By clearing the stored codes, you will allow the boost pressure bypass valve system to return to a normal mode before you continue testing. \n\n A scanner (or code reader), digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a system wiring diagram or manufacturer\u2019s service manual (with diagnostic flow charts) will prove necessary as well\n Take care to disconnect system controllers and components from the circuit prior to testing resistance/continuity with a DVOM \n The boost control valve is often condemned in error when the boost pressure sensor is actually faulty \n To prevent misdiagnosis, which could cause unnecessary replacement of parts, perform exhaustive testing of individual circuits and components related to this code  \n I utilize a (DVOM) for testing. This will allow you to determine if system circuit voltage and resistance levels are within manufacturer\u2019s specifications. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nTrans Am LT1 P0039 codeI have a \u201896 trans am LT1 that thru a code P0039.

  "P0040": {
    "Meaning": "P0040 O2 Sensor Signals Swapped Bank 1 Bank 2 Sensor 1",
    "Common Causes": "In a nutshell, a P0040 code means that the vehicle's computer (the PCM or powertrain control module) has detected that the first O2 oxygen sensors downstream from the engine have swapped wiring. The vehicle's PCM uses the oxygen sensor readings to adjust how much fuel to inject into the engine for most efficient operation. The PCM monitors the engine sensor readings and if for example it puts more fuel into bank 2 of the engine but then sees that the bank 1 oxygen sensor is reacting instead of bank 2, that is the type of thing that triggers this code. For this DTC, the first O2 oxygen sensor that is in the exhaust manifold or downstream from it is the sensor #1. It will be upstream from the catalytic converter.\nThis trouble code is not common and only applies to vehicles with engines that have more than one bank of cylinders. If you have an inline engine you won't get this code.

Ignoring this code could lead to a damaged catalytic converter which is very costly.\nCauses\nA P0040 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:\n\nOxygen sensor wiring connectors swapped from bank to bank (most likely)\nO2 sensor wiring crossed, damaged, and/or shorted\nFailed PCM (less likely)\n\nPossible Solutions\nA good first step is to find out if there was any recent work done in the area of the exhaust and O2 sensors. If there was, then there is a good chance that the most likely cause is the issue. That is, swapped wiring connectors for the first O2 sensor from bank 1 to bank 2.\nVisually inspect all wiring and connectors leading to the first O2 sensors (these will be between the engine and catalytic converters). Look to see if the wires are intact and not burned or twisted, etc. More than likely the connectors are swapped. If you are a DIY you could even try swapping these front two oxygen wiring connectors as a first repair step, then clear the trouble codes and road test to see if the code returns. If it does not return then that was most likely the problem.\nA next step would be to closely inspect the O2 wiring & connectors at the PCM end. Make sure wires are in the correct pin locations going into the PCM and it's harness (refer to a vehicle specific repair manual for that). Be aware if there are swapped wires, damaged wires, etc. Repair as required.\nIf necessary, perform a continuity test of each individual wire from the PCM to the O2 sensor. Repair as necessary.\nIf you have access to an advanced scan tool, use it to monitor (graph) the O2 sensor readings and compare to specs.

  "P0042": {
    "Meaning": "P0042 Heated Oxygen Sensor Control Circuit B1S3",
    "Common Causes": "The oxygen sensors used a heated circuit to warm up the sensor for faster feedback operation.  The oxygen sensor may use three or four wires depending on the vehicle, two are usually used for the sensor feedback to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) / Engine Control Module (ECM) and the other wires are for the heater to power the heated circuit.  Three wire sensors are usually grounded through the exhaust system, and four wire sensors have a seperate ground wire.\nThe P0042 code refers to the third sensor downstream from the engine on bank 1, which is on the side of the engine with the #1 cylinder.  The heater circuit may be supplied power or ground by the PCM/ECM or another source that can be controlled by the PCM/ECM.\nNote: Be careful not to work around an exhaust system that has been ran recently as they can become very hot.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0042 DTC includes MIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination. You will probably not notice anyother symptoms associated with the failure of the heated circuit since it only runs momentarily when the vehicle is first started.  This sensor is also after the catalytic converter, so it will not affect the air/fuel ratio input to the PCM/ECM; it is primarily used to verify the catalytic converters efficiency.\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0042 trouble code may include:\n\nOpen circuit inside oxygen sensor or open power or ground wires to bank 1, #3 oxygen sensor\nExhaust system ground strap may have become corroded or broken\nPCM/ECM or oxygen sensor heater circuit wiring has failed\n\nPossible Solutions\nVisually inspect the oxygen sensor wiring for damaged or loose wiring to the sensor.\nUnplug the oxygen sensor and using a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM) set to the ohms scale, test the resistance of the heater circuit using a wiring diagram for reference.  The heater circuit inside the sensor should have some resistance present, excessive resistance or an over limit reading would indicate an open in the heated portion of the circuit and the oxygen sensor will need to be replaced. \nBack-probe the ground wire at the connector and check for resistance between a good known ground and the connector to the oxygen sensor. \nBack-probe the power supply wire at the connector with the DVOM set to DC volts with the positive lead on the power supply wire and the negative lead at a good known ground to check for power to supply at the oxygen sensor.  If no power is present at the connector during initial car startup (cold start), there may be a problem with the power supply circuit to the oxygen sensor or the PCM itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n03 Jeep Liberty P0042Hi, I have a 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport. 3.7 V6 I bought a pocket scanner. a actron CP9125.

The PCM continuously monitors the heater circuits for abnormal voltages or in some cases, even amperages. Depending on the make of vehicle, the Oxygen sensor heater is controlled one of two ways. One way is that the PCM directly controls the voltage feed to the heater either directly or via a HO2S relay and a ground is supplied from the vehicle's common ground.

  "P0049": {
    "Meaning": "P0049 Turbo / Supercharger Turbine Overspeed",
    "Common Causes": "As forced air induction systems, turbochargers and superchargers are both used to increase engine performance. By design, ambient air is drawn into each type of device, which then compresses the air and forces it into the engine combustion chambers. The method in which they are driven is the most significant difference between the turbocharger and supercharger. While the supercharger is driven by a belt that runs off the engine crankshaft, the turbocharger is driven by engine exhaust. In order to make the air that is introduced to the engine even cooler and denser, FAI systems often use some type of intercooler. A methanol or cold water injection may also be utilized for this purpose.\nThe boost controller is usually an integrated part of the PCM. Data from engine and transmission sensors is calculated by the PCM to determine the degree of boost pressure required for the engine to perform at an optimum level. To determine whether or not boost pressure meets desired levels, it is monitored (by the PCM) using one or more boost pressure sensors. The PCM compares actual boost pressure with desired boost pressure and activates bypass control valves and/or blow-off valves (as required) to prevent an overboost condition.\nMost bypass control valves and blow-off valves are actuated electronically. Prior to attempting a diagnosis for a code P0049, consult a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) for information regarding the forced air induction control system for your vehicle. \nIf the PCM detects a level of boost pressure that is higher than the programmed limit, a code P0049 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nRelated turbo / supercharger engine trouble codes:\n\nP0045 Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"A\" Circuit/Open\nP0046 Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"A\" Circuit Range/Performance\nP0047 Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"A\" Circuit Low\nP0048 Turbocharger/Supercharger Boost Control \"A\" Circuit High\n\nSymptoms & Severity\nA genuine turbocharger/supercharger overboost condition could result in severe FAI device and/or engine damage therefore a stored code P0049 should be treated as severe. \nSymptoms of a P0049 code may include:\n\nLoud noises from the wastegate and/or hoses especially under acceleration\nThick black smoke from the exhaust\nHigher engine and/or transmission temperatures\nSpark detonation is possible due to elevated cylinder temperature\nFouled spark plugs\nAdditional codes may also be stored, including other turbocharger boost related codes, knock sensor codes, or engine misfire codes \n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Faulty boost pressure sensor\nBad turbocharger bypass valve, wastegate, or blow-off valve\nMechanical turbocharger/supercharger failure\nDisconnected, cracked, or collapsed vacuum lines (vacuum actuated bypass valve)\nDisconnected or damaged turbocharger hoses\nLoose, corroded, or disconnected electrical connectors in boost pressure sensor circuits\nDefective PCM, boost controller, or PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), a reliable vehicle information source (like All Data DIY), and a manual boost pressure gauge will be necessary to diagnose a code P0049.\nI like to begin with a thorough inspection of all wiring, turbocharger supply hoses, and vacuum hoses related to the turbocharger and boost control system, when attempting to diagnose a P0049.\nNext, I\u2019d continue by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieving all stored trouble codes. Writing the codes (and pertinent freeze frame data) down may prove helpful later in your diagnosis. After that, clear the codes and test drive the vehicle (if possible) and see if the code is reset. Should the code immediately reset, execute a manual boost pressure test and compare actual findings with manufacturer\u2019s specifications. If actual boost pressure exceeds maximum requirements, suspect a problem in the bypass control system or outlet piping system.\nNormal boost pressure for modern forced air induction systems is between nine and fourteen-pounds.  If actual boost pressure is within manufacturer\u2019s specifications, suspect a defective boost pressure sensor, a bad PCM, or a PCM programming error. Use the DVOM and your vehicle information source to test the boost pressure sensor and system circuits as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nOEM Number to Cross: P00495 - 2003 Chevy Trailblazer LT, 2WDI have a 2003 Chevy Trailblazer LT, 2WD, 6 cylinder.\nThe cooling fan has been running unusually high and our check engine light came on.\nI took it down to AutoZone and the code above came back.\nI was told to start by switching out the fan relay [part: Santech MT0506].\nCan someone help me locate the ...\u00a0Diagnosi P004900 Velocit\u00e0 eccessiva della turbina compressoreBuonasera a tutti,\n\nho una Volvo XC60 D3 cilindrata 2.0 163CV anno 2010, mi esce il seguente errore in diagnosi \"P004900 Velocit\u00e0 eccessiva della turbina del compressore/turbocaricatore\", in pi\u00f9 la macchina da dei vuoti solo in accelerazione con marce alte.\n\nHo gi\u00e0 eseguito la revisione della tur...\u00a0\nNeed more help with a p0049 code?\nIf you still need help regarding the P0049 trouble code, please post \n  your question in our FREE car repair forums.\nWe are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\nShare\n\n\nNOTE: This information is presented for information purposes only. \n  It is not intended as repair advice and we are not responsible for any actions \n  you take on any vehicle.

  "P0050": {
    "Meaning": "P0050 HO2S Heater Control Circuit B2S1",
    "Common Causes": "This information is then relayed to the ECM. The ECM uses this information to adjust the fuel delivered to the engine. A Heated Oxygen sensor contains a circuit dedicated to operating a heater that warms up the Oxygen sensor faster than the exhaust gasses could. This shortens the time the engine needs to achieve closed loop, which decreases emissions.\nOn some vehicles the O2 sensor heater is fed a 12V fused supply voltage and a computer controlled ground. The 12V supply voltage is supplied to the heater anytime the key is in the on position. The computer activates the heater under certain circumstances by completing the ground to the oxygen sensor heater. On other vehicles the O2 sensor heater may be supplied a computer controlled 12 volts feed and continuous ground. If the ECM detects a fault on the Bank 2, sensor 1 heater circuit a P0050 may set. This code refers to Bank 2, which is the side (bank of cylinders) that doesn't contain cylinder #1. This DTC is basically identical to P0030 but on a different Bank.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0050 DTC may include:\n\nLengthened time needed to achieve closed loop\nMIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nPossibly decreased fuel mileage depending on fault\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0050 trouble code may include:\n\nFailed or damaged heater circuit element inside the HO2S\nOpen on the O2 sensor heater's ground circuit\nOpen or short on O2 sensor heater's B+ battery feed (on some vehicles this may be the control circuit)\nPossible ECM failure (less likely)\n\nPossible Solutions\nMany times a HO2 sensors heater element may go bad due to age or impact. Keep this in mind when making your inspection. Make a visual inspection of the Bank 2, Sensor 1 O2 sensor. Repair any damaged wiring from contact with exhaust.\nIf HO2 Sensor itself appears to have been damaged, replace it. If a visual inspection reveals no obvious problems, viewing the faulty heater circuit on a scan tool may reveal if the fault is currently occurring. If the scan tool datastream shows that the Bank 2, Sensor 1 heater element is pulling 0 amps then suspect an open in the circuit. Check for blown fuses and then disconnect the O2 sensor connector.\nWith key on engine off use a voltmeter to check for 12 volts fused battery feed to the heater element. If there is no voltage present, repair open or short in the B+ feed circuit remembering to replace any fuse blown from the short. If the B+ battery feed is intact, remove the ground (control) circuit from the ECM wiring connector and check for resistance on the circuit. If there is infinite resistance, repair open in the circuit. If the control circuit checks out, suspect a bad O2 sensor. Replace and re-check.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2001 Saturn L- series, 3.0L, codes P0030, P0050, runs bad2001 Saturn 3.0, started running poorly with CEL on, codes P0030, P0050, and random skip codes.

  "P0051": {
    "Meaning": "P0051 - Oxygen (A/F) Sensor Heater Control Circuit Low (Bank 2 Sensor 1)",
    "Common Causes": "This O2 sensor #1 may also be refered to as an air/fuel ratio sensor since \n  on some vehicles it is. It detects the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas compared \n  to the outside air and then vehicle's computer adjusts the air/fuel ratio going \n  into the engine. The sensor is less effective when the exhaust gas temperature \n  is low, so it includes a heater which is activated to help get better readings \n  from the A/F O2 sensor. Essentially this P0051 code means that the resistance \n  of the heater circuit is lower than normal. In most cases, that resistance level \n  must fall below 0.8 A to trigger the DTC code.\nNote, this code is very similar in nature to P0031, P0032, \n  and P0052\nPotential Symptoms\nMost likely you'll not notice any symptoms other than the MIL (malfunction \n  indicator lamp, a.k.a. the check engine light) will illuminate.\nCauses\nA P0051 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:\n\nA short in the heater circuit in the sensor\nA failed O2 sensor heater\nWiring/connectors broken/frayed leading to sensor and/or relay\nFailed PCM/ECM\n\nPossible Solutions\nTo fix a P0051 DTC code, you'll need to do a proper diagnosis. To do that, \n  you'll want to inspect the wiring and connectors leading to the sensor. Also \n  if equipped with a heater relay and fuse, you'll want to check those as well. \n  Use a digital volt ohm meter to:\n\ncheck for 12 volts at the heater circuit feed (hint: unplug the sensor and \n    check at the wiring connector to do this measurement)\ncheck the ground circuit for continuity\nmeasure the resistance of the heater circuit (done on the sensor itself)\nmeasure the resistance and voltage of the wiring\n\nRefer to a service manual for the correct specifications (volts, ohms) for \n  your vehicle. On some Toyota vehicles this code is triggered when the resistance \n  of the heater circuit is below 0.8 A.\nWith that said, a common fix for this DTC is to replace the air/fuel (O2 oxygen) \n  sensor #1 on bank 2 (the side of the engine that doesn't contain cylinder #1).\nPlease keep in mind that OEM (original equipment) replacement sensors are recommended \n  (from the dealer). Aftermarket sensors can be less reliable and of poorer quality \n  (not always, but more often). There's also a chance that replacement parts for \n  the P0051 code may also fall under a federal emissions warranty (check with \n  your dealer to see if it's covered).\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2005 Jeep Wranger TJ O2 Sensor Codes P0031 P0037 P0051 and P00572005 Jeep Wrangler TJ - 4.0 I6\n\nP0031 02 (B1 S1) Heater Circuit Low\nP0037 O2 (B1 S2) Heater Circuit Low\nP0051 O2 (B2 S1) Heater Relay Circuit Low\nP0057 O2 (B2 S2) Heater Relay Circuit Low\n\nMy vehicle has just over 116,000 miles on it.

  "P0052": {
    "Meaning": "P0052 - Oxygen (A/F) Sensor Heater Control Circuit High (Bank 2 Sensor 1)",
    "Common Causes": "This O2 sensor #1 may also be refered to as an air/fuel ratio sensor since \n  on some vehicles it is. The sensor detects the amount of oxygen in the exhaust \n  gas compared to the outside air and then vehicle's computer adjusts the air/fuel \n  ratio going into the engine. The sensor is less effective when the exhaust gas \n  temperature is low, so it includes a heater which is activated to help get better \n  readings from the O2 sensor. Essentially this P0052 code means that the resistance \n  of the heater circuit is higher than normal. In some cases, that resistance \n  level must be higher than 10 A to trigger the DTC code.\nNote, this code is very similar in nature to P0031, P0032, \n  and P0051\nPotential Symptoms\nMost likely you'll not notice any symptoms other than the MIL (malfunction \n  indicator lamp, a.k.a. the check engine light) will illuminate.\nCauses\nA P0052 DTC trouble code may be caused by one or more of the following:\n\nA short in the heater circuit in the sensor\nA failed O2 sensor heater\nWiring/connectors broken/frayed leading to sensor and/or relay\nFailed PCM/ECM\n\nPossible Solutions\n To fix a P0052 DTC code, you'll need to do a proper diagnosis. To do that, \n  you'll want to inspect the wiring and connectors leading to the sensor. Also \n  if equipped with a heater relay and fuse, you'll want to check those as well. \n  Use a digital volt ohm meter to:\n\ncheck for 12 volts at the heater circuit feed (hint: unplug the sensor and \n    check at the wiring connector to do this measurement)\ncheck the ground circuit for continuity\nmeasure the resistance of the heater circuit (done on the sensor itself)\nmeasure the resistance and voltage of the wiring\n\nRefer to a service manual for the correct specifications (volts, ohms) for \n  your vehicle. On some Toyota vehicles this code is triggered when the resistance \n  of the heater circuit is above 10 A.\nWith that said, a common fix for this DTC is to replace the air/fuel (O2 oxygen) \n  sensor #2 on bank 1.\nPlease keep in mind that OEM (original equipment) replacement sensors are recommended \n  (from the dealer). Aftermarket sensors can be less reliable and of poorer quality \n  (not always, but more often). There's also a chance that replacement parts for \n  the P0052 code may also fall under a federal emissions warranty (check with \n  your dealer to see if it's covered).\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n06 Jeep Wrangerl 4.0 Multiple HO2S codes P0032 P0038 P0052 P0058I have an '06 Jeep Wrangler w/4.0l, and at random intervals it throws the following 4 codes: P0032, P0038, P0052, and P0058.

  "P0053": {
    "Meaning": "P0053 HO2S Heater Resistance Bank 1 Sensor 1",
    "Common Causes": "O2 sensors are made with a zirconium dioxide sensing element protected by a vented steel housing. The sensing element is attached to wire leads in the O2 sensor wiring harness using platinum electrodes. The controller area network (CAN) connects the PCM to the O2 sensor wiring harness. The O2 sensor provides the PCM with data regarding the percentage of oxygen particles in the engine exhaust as compared to the oxygen content of ambient air.\nIn the heated O2 sensor, battery voltage is used to preheat the sensor during cold start conditions. In addition to the O2 sensor signal circuits there is also a circuit dedicated to heating the sensor. It typically carries battery voltage (12.6-volts minimum) and may have an in-line fuse. When the PCM detects that engine coolant temperature conditions are within a programmed limit, battery voltage is applied to the O2 sensor heater circuit until the PCM enters closed loop operation. Voltage is usually routed through the PCM, sometimes with help from a relay and/or fuses, and is initiated when the ignition switch is turned on during cold start conditions. Once the engine reaches normal operating temperature, the PCM is programmed to discontinue battery voltage to the O2 heater circuit and takes measures to do so.\nIf the PCM detects a level of resistance from the O2 sensor heater circuit that is greater than programmed limitations allow, a code P0053 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will likely be illuminated. Some vehicles may require multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) for the MIL to be illuminated. For this reason you will need to use the OBD-II readiness mode in order to make sure that your repairs are successful. After completing repairs, drive the vehicle until the PCM enters readiness mode or the code is reset.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nSince a P0053 code means that the upstream O2 sensor heater is basically inoperable, it should be addressed at your earliest convenience. Symptoms of a this engine code may include:\n\n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Black smoke from exhaust due to a rich cold start condition \n Delayed start up due to a lean cold start condition \n Other related diagnostic trouble codes may also be stored\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0053 trouble code may include:\n\n A faulty O2 sensor \n Burnt, broken, or disconnected wiring and/or connectors \n Blown fuse or burnt fusible link \n Defective engine control relay\n\nPossible Solutions\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nTo diagnose a code P0053, I would gain access to a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source, such as All Data DIY. \nI would normally begin with a visual inspection of system wiring harnesses and connectors; focusing on harnesses that are routed near hot exhaust pipes and manifolds, as well as those that are routed near sharp edges like the ones found on exhaust shields.\nUse the DVOM to test all system fuses and fusible links. Use caution to test these components when they are under load. Fuses that aren\u2019t loaded may seem operational, then fail when loaded. Loading this circuit can be accomplished by making sure the O2 sensor heaters are activated. \nI would continue by retrieving all stored trouble codes and freeze frame data. This is done by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port. Write this information down as it could be helpful if the P0053 proves to be intermittent. Next, I\u2019d clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if the P0053 is immediately reset.\nShould the P0053 be reset, make sure that the engine is cold enough to allow the O2 sensor heater to be activated. Bring up the scanner data stream and observe O2 sensor heater input data. Narrow the data stream display to include only pertinent data so you can get a faster data response.  If the engine is within the correct temperature range, O2 sensor heater voltage should be the same as battery voltage. A P0053 will be stored if O2 sensor heater voltage varies from that of the battery, due to a resistance issue.\nConnect the DVOM test leads to the sensor ground and battery voltage signal wires in order to monitor live data from the O2 sensor. You may also be use the DVOM to check resistance of the O2 sensor in question. Disconnect all related controllers prior to testing system circuit resistance with the DVOM. \nAdditional diagnostic tips & notes:\n\n The O2 sensor heater circuit should be energized when the engine is below normal operating temperature \n If blown fuses are found, suspect that the O2 heater circuit has shorted to ground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nGMC Yukon 2009 5.3 codes p0030 p0135 p0053If anybody can give me a little bit of advice I'd greatly appreciate it, I am getting codes p0030 p0135 p0053 I have already changed out all O2 sensors and have cleared them all with a scanner and I'm still pulling these codes.

Symptoms of a this engine code may include:\n\n Delayed start up due to a lean cold start condition \n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Black smoke from exhaust due to a rich cold start condition\n Other related diagnostic trouble codes may also be stored\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0055 trouble code may include:\n\n Burnt, broken, or disconnected wiring and/or connectors \n A faulty O2 sensor \n Blown fuse or burnt fusible link \nDefective engine control relay\n\nPossible Solutions\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nWhen attempting to diagnose a code P0055, I would gain access to a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source, such as All Data DIY.  \nI would likely begin with a visual inspection of system wiring harnesses and connectors. I would pay particular attention to harnesses that are routed near hot exhaust pipes and manifolds and those that are routed near sharp edges like the ones found on exhaust shields.\nNext, I might proceed by using the DVOM to test all system fuses and fusible links. Skilled technicians would test these components when they are under load because fuses that aren\u2019t loaded may seem operational; then fail when loaded. You may effectively load this circuit by activating the O2 sensor heater/s. \nMy next step would be retrieving all stored trouble codes and freeze frame data. This can be done by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port. I write this information down as it could be helpful if the P0055 proves to be intermittent. Now, I\u2019d clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if the P0055 is immediately reset.\nWhen the engine is cool enough to allow the O2 sensor heater to be activated, and the code is reset, observe O2 sensor heater input data using the scanner data stream. You may want to narrow the data stream display to include only pertinent data as this will yield a faster data response.  If the engine is within the correct temperature range, O2 sensor heater voltage should be the about the same as battery voltage. If a resistance issue causes O2 sensor heater voltage to vary from that of the battery, a P0055 will be stored.\nYou may connect the DVOM test leads to the sensor ground and battery voltage signal wires in order to monitor live data from the O2 sensor heater circuit. Test O2 sensor resistance using the DVOM. Keep in mind that all related controllers should be disconnected prior to testing system circuit resistance with the DVOM. \nAdditional diagnostic tips & notes:\n\n The O2 sensor heater circuit should be energized when the engine is below normal operating temperature \n If blown fuses are found, suspect that the O2 heater circuit in question has shorted to ground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\np2279 p0055 on 2006 vw passat 3.62006 passat 3.6\nRough idle when in park or neutral drives fine.

    "Meaning": "P0056 Heated Oxygen Sensor Control Circuit B1S2",
    "Common Causes": "The oxygen sensors used a heated circuit to warm up the sensor for faster feedback operation.  The oxygen sensor may use three or four wires depending on the vehicle, two are usually used for the sensor feedback to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) / Engine Control Module (ECM) and the other wires are for the heater to power the heated circuit.  Three wire sensors are usually grounded through the exhaust system, and four wire sensors have a seperate ground wire.\nThe P0056 code refers to the sensor after the catalytic converter on Bank 2, which is on the side of the engine that does NOT contain the #1 cylinder.  The heater circuit may be supplied power or ground by the PCM/ECM or another source that can be controlled by the PCM/ECM.\nNote: Be careful not to work around an exhaust system that has been ran recently as they can become very hot.   This code is similar to P0030 and basically identical to P0036.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0056 DTC includes MIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination. You will probably not notice anyother symptoms associated with the failure of the heated circuit since it only runs momentarily when the vehicle is first started.  This sensor is also after the catalytic converter, so it will not affect the air/fuel ratio input to the PCM/ECM; it is primarily used to verify the catalytic converters efficiency.\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0056 trouble code may include:\n\nOpen circuit inside oxygen sensor or open power or ground wires to oxygen sensor\nExhaust system ground strap may have become corroded or broken\nPCM/ECM or oxygen sensor heater circuit wiring has failed\n\nPossible Solutions\nVisually inspect the oxygen sensor wiring for damaged or loose wiring to the sensor.\nUnplug the oxygen sensor and using a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM) set to the ohms scale, test the resistance of the heater circuit using a wiring diagram for reference.  The heater circuit inside the sensor should have some resistance present, excessive resistance or an over limit reading would indicate an open in the heated portion of the circuit and the oxygen sensor will need to be replaced. \nBack-probe the ground wire at the connector and check for resistance between a good known ground and the connector to the oxygen sensor. \nBack-probe the power supply wire at the connector with the DVOM set to DC volts with the positive lead on the power supply wire and the negative lead at a good known ground to check for power to supply at the oxygen sensor.  If no power is present at the connector during initial car startup (cold start), there may be a problem with the power supply circuit to the oxygen sensor or the PCM itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2008 Cadillac SRX code p0056I need help we have replaced fuse and new 02 sensor wires all look good still check engine light comes back on same code p0056...\u00a0Intermittant STFT and P0056Hello all,\nI have been chasing an issue on a 2005 Kia Sportage.

    "Common Causes": "Heated Oxygen sensors (HO2S) are inputs used by the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) to determine oxygen content in the exhaust system. Bank 2, sensor 2 refers to the second sensor back on Bank 2. The PCM uses the information gained from the Bank 2,2 HO2S mainly to monitor the efficiency of the catalytic converter. Integral to this sensor is a heater element\n The PCM controls this heater to warm up the sensor to operating temperature. This allows the engine to enter closed loop faster and reduces emissions on cold startup. The PCM continuously monitors the heater circuits for abnormal voltages or in some cases, even amperages. Depending on the make of vehicle, the Oxygen sensor heater is controlled one of two ways. One way is that the PCM directly controls the voltage feed to the heater either directly or via a HO2S relay and a ground is supplied from the vehicle's common ground. The other way would be a fused 12 volt Battery feed (B+) that feeds 12 volts to the heater element anytime the ignition is on and the control of the heater is done by a driver in the PCM which controls the ground side of the heater circuit.\nFinding out which one you have is important because the PCM activates the heater under various circumstances.

The sensing element is attached to wire leads in the O2 sensor wiring harness using platinum electrodes. The controller area network (CAN) connects the PCM to the O2 sensor wiring harness. The O2 sensor provides the PCM with data regarding the percentage of oxygen particles in the engine exhaust as compared to the oxygen content of ambient air.\nIn the heated O2 sensor, battery voltage is used to preheat the sensor during cold start conditions.

When the PCM detects that engine coolant temperature conditions are within a programmed limit, battery voltage is applied to the O2 sensor heater circuit until the PCM enters closed loop operation. Voltage is usually routed through the PCM, sometimes with help from a relay and/or fuses, and is initiated when the ignition switch is turned on during cold start conditions. Once the engine reaches normal operating temperature, the PCM is programmed to discontinue battery voltage to the O2 heater circuit and takes measures to do so.\nIf the PCM detects a level of resistance from the O2 sensor heater circuit that is greater than programmed limitations allow, a code P0059 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will likely be illuminated.

  "P0061": {
    "Meaning": "P0061 HO2S Heater Resistance Bank 2 Sensor 3",
    "Common Causes": "A zirconium dioxide sensing element, protected by a vented steel housing, lies at the heart of your typical O2 sensor. The sensing element is connected to wire leads in the O2 sensor wiring harness with platinum electrodes. Data from the O2 sensor is transmitted to the PCM via the controller area network (CAN). The data consists of information regarding the percentage of oxygen particles in the engine exhaust as compared to the oxygen content of ambient air. The data is used by the PCM to calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing. Battery voltage is used by the PCM as a means to preheat the O2 sensor during cold start conditions. The O2 sensor signal circuits are complemented by a circuit dedicated to preheating the sensor. The heater circuit usually consists of a battery voltage wire (12.6-volts minimum) and a system ground wire. The PCM takes measures to apply battery voltage to the O2 sensor heater during low engine coolant temperature conditions. This usually occurs until the PCM enters closed loop operation. Voltage is routed through the PCM, sometimes with the help of a relay and/or fuses. The circuit is energized when the ignition switch is turned on during cold start conditions. The PCM is programmed to de-energize the O2 heater circuit once the engine reaches normal operating temperature.\nWhen the PCM detects a level of resistance, from the O2 sensor heater circuit, that is greater than programmed limitations; a code P0061 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Certain vehicles could require multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) for the MIL to be illuminated. If this applies to your vehicle, you will need to use the OBD-II readiness mode in order to make sure that your repairs are successful. Once repairs are performed, drive the vehicle until the PCM either enters readiness mode or the code is reset. \nSeverity & Symptoms\nWhen a code P0061 is stored, it should be considered severe because it means that the upstream O2 sensor heater is inoperable.

  "P0062": {
    "Meaning": "P0062 HO2S Heater Control Circuit B2S3",
    "Common Causes": "The oxygen sensors used a heated circuit to warm up the sensor for faster feedback operation.  The oxygen sensor may use three or four wires depending on the vehicle, two are usually used for the sensor feedback to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) / Engine Control Module (ECM) and the other wires are for the heater to power the heated circuit.  Three wire sensors are usually grounded through the exhaust system, and four wire sensors have a separate ground wire.\nThe P0062 code refers to third downstream sensor in the exhaust on Bank 2, which is on the side of the engine that does NOT contain the #1 cylinder.  The heater circuit may be supplied power or ground by the PCM/ECM or another source that can be controlled by the PCM/ECM.\nNote: Be careful not to work around an exhaust system that has been ran recently as they can become very hot.   This code is similar to P0030 and basically identical to P0036.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0062 DTC includes MIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination. You will probably not notice any other symptoms associated with the failure of the heated circuit since it only runs momentarily when the vehicle is first started.

The heater circuit inside the sensor should have some resistance present, excessive resistance or an over limit reading would indicate an open in the heated portion of the circuit and the oxygen sensor will need to be replaced. \nBack-probe the ground wire at the connector and check for resistance between a good known ground and the connector to the oxygen sensor. \nBack-probe the power supply wire at the connector with the DVOM set to DC volts with the positive lead on the power supply wire and the negative lead at a good known ground to check for power to supply at the oxygen sensor.

The PCM continuously monitors the heater circuits for abnormal voltages or in some cases, even amperages. Depending on the make of vehicle, the Oxygen sensor heater is controlled one of two ways. One way is that the PCM directly controls the voltage feed to the heater either directly or via a HO2S relay and a ground is supplied from the vehicle's common ground. The other way would be a fused 12 volt Battery feed (B+) that feeds 12 volts to the heater element anytime the ignition is on and the control of the heater is done by a driver in the PCM which controls the ground side of the heater circuit.\nFinding out which one you have is important because the PCM activates the heater under various circumstances.

    "Meaning": "P0064 HO2S Heater Control Circuit High (Bank 2 Sensor 3)",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM uses the information gained from the Bank 2, 3 (third) HO2S mainly to monitor the efficiency of the catalytic converter. Integral to this sensor is a heater element. While in pre-OBD II vehicles an Oxygen sensor was a one wire sensor, now they are more commonly 4 wire sensors: Two dedicated to the oxygen sensor and two dedicated to the heater element. The oxygen sensor heater basically decreases the time needed to achieve closed loop. The PCM controls the heater on-time. The PCM also continuously monitors the heater circuits for abnormal voltages or in some cases, even abnormal amperages.\nDepending on the make of vehicle, the Oxygen sensor heater is controlled one of two ways.

    "Common Causes": "The atomization that happens when air is introduced to a normal injector is desired simply because it aids in a more evenly distributed spray. This matters because generally speaking, these systems only use one injector mounted to the throttle body or intake and the atomized fuel spray is distributed between X number cylinders.\nThe ECM (engine control module) illuminates the check engine light with P0065 and associated codes when it monitors a condition outside of a specific range within the Air Assisted Injector's circuit. Generally speaking this is an electrical issue but sometime an internal malfunction within the injector itself may cause this condition.\nP0065 Air Assisted Injector Control Range/Performance code is set when the ECM monitors an out of range condition within the injector. This air assisted injector control DTC is closely related to P0066 and P0067.\nWhat is the severity of this DTC?\nI would say the severity of this code is moderate to low. Reason being, it will not affect overall performance of engine at normal operating temperature. That being said, it will need to be addressed eventually as consistent cold starts with a possibly lean mixture could cause serious damage in the long run. \nWhat are some of the symptoms of the code?\nSymptoms of a P0065 engine code may include:\n Hard to start when engine is cold\nSmoking\nPoor performance when cold\nEngine misfiring\nPoor fuel mileage\n\nWhat are some of the common causes of the code?\nCauses for this code may include:\n\nBroken or damaged wiring harness\n Vacuum leak within injector or in hoses/clamps\nFuse/relay defective\nAir Assisted Fuel Injector defective\nECM issue\nPin/connector problem. (e.g. corrosion, overheating, etc.)\n\nWhat are some troubleshooting steps?\nBe sure to check for technical service bulletins (TSBs) for your vehicle. Getting access to a known fix can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nTools\nWhenever you are working with electrical systems, some of the basic tools that are a good idea to have are:\n\nOBD code reader\nMultimeter\nBasic socket set\nBasic ratchet and wrench sets\nBasic screwdriver set\nRag/shop towels\nBattery terminal cleaner\nService manual\n\nSafety Tips\n\n Let engine cool\nChalk wheels\nWear PPE (Personal protective equipment)\n\nBasic Step #1\nRefer to your service manual for the location of the injector on your particular make and model. Most times, you can find the injector mounted to the throttle body itself. Sometimes the vacuum lines/gaskets around the injector leak causing it to perform outside of the desired range, pay special attention here as this would be the best case scenario. Fixing vacuum hoses/gaskets are generally inexpensive and easy to repair. With the engine running, listen for any abnormal whistle noises around theses hoses indicating a leak. If you know how to operate a vacuum gauge, you will want to monitor the vacuum within the intake system while the engine is running. Record your findings and compare to your specific desired value.\nNOTE: Replace any cracked vacuum hoses. These are problems waiting to happen and if you are replacing any hoses, you should inspect the rest to prevent yourself a future headache.\nBasic Step #2\nTest your injector. The desired electrical values within the injector varies heavily between makes and models but refer to your service manual for specifications. Most likely this will involve using your multimeter to measure resistance between the electrical pins on the injector.\nNOTE: Always use appropriate multimeter lead connectors when testing pins/connectors. Too many times, techs bend pins when testing electrical components causing hard-to-diagnose intermittent problems. Be careful!\nBasic Tip #3\nLocate the electrical connector on the injector. Inspect for any corrosion or defects present. Repair or replace as necessary. Given the location of the injector, the harness may be routed around some tight areas where chafing may occur. Make sure the harness' and wires are in good condition and are secured properly.\nNOTE: Make sure to disconnect battery before performing any electrical repairs.\nBasic Step #4\nTest the injector circuit. You may be able to disconnect the connector on the injector itself and the other end at the ECM. If this is possible and easy in your case, you may want to make sure you are getting continuity in the wires within the circuit. Generally you will use a multimeter and test the resistance within the particular circuit. Another test you could do is a voltage drop test. It will determine the integrity of the wire.\nBasic Step #5\nDepending on your scan tool's capabilities, you may be able to monitor the Air assisted injector's operation while vehicle is running. If you can monitor actual values and compare them to specific desired values, this could help you in determining what's going on.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2002 Jaguar S Type OBD-ll code P0065I have a 2002 Jaguar S Type 4.0 V-8 with the code P0065.

Most times, you can find the injector mounted to the throttle body itself. Sometimes the vacuum lines/gaskets around the injector leak causing it to perform outside of the desired range, pay special attention here as this would be the best case scenario. Fixing vacuum hoses/gaskets are generally inexpensive and easy to repair. With the engine running, listen for any abnormal whistle noises around theses hoses indicating a leak. If you know how to operate a vacuum gauge, you will want to monitor the vacuum within the intake system while the engine is running. Record your findings and compare to your specific desired value.\nNOTE: Replace any cracked vacuum hoses. These are problems waiting to happen and if you are replacing any hoses, you should inspect the rest to prevent yourself a future headache.\nBasic Step #2\nTest your injector. The desired electrical values within the injector varies heavily between makes and models but refer to your service manual for specifications. Most likely this will involve using your multimeter to measure resistance between the electrical pins on the injector.\nNOTE: Always use appropriate multimeter lead connectors when testing pins/connectors. Too many times, techs bend pins when testing electrical components causing hard-to-diagnose intermittent problems. Be careful!\nBasic Tip #3\nLocate the electrical connector on the injector. Inspect for any corrosion or defects present. Repair or replace as necessary. Given the location of the injector, the harness may be routed around some tight areas where chafing may occur. Make sure the harness' and wires are in good condition and are secured properly.\nNOTE: Make sure to disconnect battery before performing any electrical repairs.\nBasic Step #4\nTest the injector circuit. You may be able to disconnect the connector on the injector itself and the other end at the ECM. If this is possible and easy in your case, you may want to make sure you are getting continuity in the wires within the circuit. Generally you will use a multimeter and test the resistance within the particular circuit. Another test you could do is a voltage drop test. It will determine the integrity of the wire.\nBasic Step #5\nDepending on your scan tool's capabilities, you may be able to monitor the Air assisted injector's operation while vehicle is running.

  "P0067": {
    "Meaning": "P0067 Air Assisted Injector Control Circuit High",
    "Common Causes": "The atomization that happens when air is introduced to a normal injector is desired simply because it aids in a more evenly distributed spray. This matters because generally speaking, these systems only use one injector mounted to the throttle body or intake and the atomized fuel spray is distributed between X number cylinders.\nThe ECM (engine control module) illuminates the check engine light with P0067 and associated codes when it monitors a condition outside of a specific range within the Air Assisted Injector's circuit. Generally speaking this is an electrical issue but sometime an internal malfunction within the injector itself may cause this condition.\nP0067 Air Assisted Injector Control Circuit High code is set when the ECM monitors one or more high electrical value within the circuit. This air assisted injector control DTC is closely related to P0065 and P0066.\nWhat is the severity of this DTC?\nI would say the severity of this code is moderate to low.

  "P0068": {
    "Meaning": "P0068 MAP/MAF - Throttle Position Correlation",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM relies on three sensors to indicate air flow volume in order to calculate fuel and timing tactics. These sensors include the mass airflow sensor, throttle position sensor and the Manifold pressure (MAP) sensor. There are many sensors on the engine however these are the three associated with this code. \nThe mass airflow sensor is located between the air cleaner and the throttle body. Its job is to signal the amount of air passing through the throttle body. In order to accomplish this, a thin piece of resistance wire the thickness of a hair stretches across in the inlet of the sensor.\nThe computer sends voltage to this wire to heat it to a predetermined temperature. As air volume increases it requires more voltage to maintain the temperature. Conversely, it requires less voltage as the air volume drops. The computer recognizes this voltage as an indication of air volume. \nThe throttle position sensor rests on the opposite side of the throttle plate in the throttle body. When closed, the throttle plate prevents airflow into the engine. Air necessary for idle bypasses the throttle valve by way of an idle air control motor. \nMost later model vehicles use a throttle position sensor on the floorboards at the top of the gas pedal. As the pedal is depressed the sensor attached to the pedal sends a voltage to an electric motor that controls the opening of the throttle plate. \nIn operation, the throttle position sensor is nothing more than a rheostat. With the throttle plate closed at idle, the throttle position sensor registers very close to 0.5 volts and when opened as in accelerating, the voltage will rise to approximately 5 volts. The transition from 0.5 to 5 volts should be very smooth. The engine's computer recognizes this increase in voltage as a signal indicating the amount of airflow and rate of opening. \nThe Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) has a dual role in this scenario. It senses the manifold pressure corrected for air density due to temperature, humidity and altitude. It is also linked to the intake manifold through a hose. When the throttle suddenly opens the manifold pressure drops just as sudden and rises again as the air flow increases.\nThe engine management computer requires all three of these sensors to accurately strategize the length of time to open the injectors and how much spark advance is necessary to maintain a 14.5/1 fuel ratio. If, for some reason one of these sensors or a mechanical problem causes a disparity between the rest, the computer is incapable of making the proper adjustments and sets the P0068 trouble code. \nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0068 code will depend on the cause of the overboost condition:\n\nThe service engine soon or check engine light will illuminate.\nRough running engine - the computer will set the above code and additional codes depicting the faulty sensor if the problem is electrical.Without the correct airflow the engine will develop a rough idle, and depending on the severity, it may not accelerate or have a serious dead spot off idle. In short, it will run lousy\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this DTC include:\n\nVacuum leaks between the mass airflow sensor and intake manifold and loose or cracked hoses\nDirty air cleaner\nLeak in the intake manifold or sections\nFaulty sensor\nCoked intake runner behind throttle body \nPoor or corroded electrical connectors \nObstruction to air flow \nDefective electronic throttle body \nObstruction in hose from intake manifold to MAP sensor \n\nDiagnostic Steps & Possible Solutions\nLike an auto technician, start with the most common problems. You will need a volt/ohmmeter, wire-piercing probe for the meter, a can of carburetor cleaner and a can of intake cleaner. Repair any problems as they are found and start the vehicle to determine if the problem is corrected -- if not continue the procedures. \nWith the engine off, open the hood and check the air cleaner element. \nLook for any loose clamps or leaks in the piping from the mass airflow sensor to the throttle body. \nInspect all the vacuum lines on the intake manifold for obstructions, cracks or looseness which could cause loss of vacuum. \nDisconnect each of the sensors and check the connector for corrosion and pushed out or bent pins. \nStart the engine and use the carburetor cleaner to find any leaks in the intake manifold. A short shot of carburetor cleaner over a leak will change the engine rpm noticeably. Hold the can at arms length to keep the spray from contacting your eyes lest you learn the lesson much like picking up a cat by the tail. You won't forget next time. Spray all connection points on the manifold for leaks. \nTake the clamp loose on the pipe connecting the mass airflow to the throttle body. Look in the throttle body to see if it's coated with coke -- a black greasy looking substance. If it is, pinch the tube from the intake cleaner bottle between the pipe and the throttle body. Push the pipe on the throttle body and start the engine. Begin the spray until the can is gone. Remove it and reconnect the pipe to the throttle body. \nTest the mass airflow sensor. Pull the connector off the sensor. Turn the ignition on with the engine off. There are three wires, 12 volt power, sensor ground and signal (usually yellow.) use the red voltmeter lead to probe the connector for 12 volts. Keep the black lead on ground. No voltage is a ignition or wiring problem. Install the connector and check the sensor ground. It must be under 100 mv. If the sensor has 12 volts and out of range on the ground, replace the sensor. This is a basic test. If it passes yet when finished with all tests and the problem still persists, the mass airflow may still be bad. Have it checked on a graphing computer such as the Tech II. \nCheck the operation of the throttle position sensor. Make sure it is seated properly and the bolts are tight. It is a three-wire connector -- dark blue for the signal, grey for the 5 volt reference voltage and a black or orange for the PCM negative wire.\n- Connect the voltmeter red lead to the blue signal wire and the black voltmeter lead to a ground. Turn the key on with the engine off. If the sensor is good it will have less than 1 volt with the throttle closed. As the throttle is advanced the voltage will rise smoothly to approximately 4 volts with no drop outs or glitches. \nCheck the MAP sensor. Turn the key on and backprobe the power reference wire with the red voltmeter lead and the black to ground. With the key on and engine off it must have 4.5 to 5 volts. Start the engine. It must have 0.5 to 1.5 volts depending on altitude and temperature. Raise the engine rpm. The voltage must react to the throttle opening by dropping and rising again. If not replace it. \n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nVauxhall code P0068could a new throttle body fix code P0068...\u00a02002 Chrysler 300m Special codes P0016, P0068, P0344, P0513My 2002 Chrysler 300M Special died on me the other day.

  "P0075": {
    "Meaning": "P0075 Intake Valve Control Solenoid Circuit B1",
    "Common Causes": "On vehicles equipped with variable valve timing (VVT), the Engine Control Module / Powertrain Control Module (ECM/PCM) controls the camshaft position by regulating the engine oil through the control solenoid to change the position of the camshaft. The control solenoid is commanded using a Pulse Width Modulated signal (PWM) from the ECM/PCM.  The ECM/PCM monitors this signal and if the voltage is out of specification or intermittent, it will set this DTC and illuminate the Check Engine Light / Malfunction Indicator Lamp (CEL/MIL). \nBank 1 refers to the side of the engine with cylinder #1 - be sure to verify according to manufacturers specifications.  The intake valve control solenoid is usually located on the intake manifold side of the cylinder head. This code is similar to codes P0076 and P0077.  This code may also be accompanied by  P0026.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\n\nCheck engine light illuminated (Malfunction indicator lamp)\nVehicle may suffer from poor acceleration and decreased fuel economy.\n\nPotential Causes\nPotential causes of a P0075 diagnostic trouble code may include:\n\nWire harness poor connection or corroded terminals\nFaulty control solenoid\nShort to power\nShort to ground\nFaulty ECM\n\nDiagnostic Steps\nWire harness - Check for unplugged harness connections, look for corrosion or loose wires to  connectors.  Unplug harness connectors from solenoid and PCM, using a wiring diagram locate  the + and - wires to the solenoid.  The solenoid can be ground side or power side controlled,  depending on the application.  Check with factory wiring diagrams to determine the power flow  in the circuit.  Using a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM) set to the ohms setting, check for  resistance between each end of the wire.  An over limit reading on the DVOM may be an open in  the wiring, loose connection or terminal.  Resistance should be around 1 ohm or less, if  there is excessive resistance there may be corrosion or bad wiring between the solenoid and  PCM/ECM.\nControl solenoid - With the electrical harness to the solenoid unplugged, using the DVOM set  to ohms, check for resistance between each of the electrical terminals on the control  solenoid itself.  Use the factory specifications or a known good control solenoid if  available to determine if there is excessive resistance in the solenoid.  If there is an over  limit or excessive resistance reading on the DVOM, the solenoid is likely faulty.  Check for  a short to ground through the control solenoid by putting either DVOM lead to a known good  ground and the other to each terminal on the control solenoid.  If there is resistance  present, the solenoid may be shorted internally.\nShort to power - Unplug the harness to the PCM/ECM and locate the wires to the control  solenoid.  With the DVOM set to the volts scale, connect the negative lead to ground and the  positive lead to the wire(s) to the control solenoid.  Check for voltage, if there voltage  present there may be a short to power in the wiring harness.  Locate the short to power by  unplugging harness connectors and testing the wiring back to the solenoid.\nShort to ground - Unplug the harness to the PCM/ECM and locate the wires to the control  solenoid.  With the DVOM set to the volts scale, connect the positive lead to a known good  voltage source such as the battery and the negative lead to the wire(s) to the control  solenoid.  Check for voltage, if there is voltage present there may be a short to ground in  the wiring harness.  Locate the short to ground by unplugging harness connectors and testing  the wiring back to the solenoid. Check for a short to ground through the control solenoid by  putting either DVOM lead to a known good ground and the other to each terminal on the control  solenoid.  If there is a low resistance present, the solenoid may be shorted internally.\nPCM / ECM - If all wiring and the control solenoid checks out okay, it will be necessary to  monitor the solenoid during engine operation by back probing the wires at the PCM/ECM.  Using  an advanced scan tool that will read the engine functions, monitor the duty cycle commanded  to the control solenoid.  It will be necessary to monitor the solenoid during engine  operation under various engine RPM's and load.  Using an oscilloscope or graphing multimeter  set to the duty cycle scale, connect the negative lead to a known good ground and the  positive lead to either wire terminal at the solenoid itself.  The reading on the multimeter  tool should match the commanded duty cycle on the scan tool.  If they are opposite, the  polarity may be reversed - connect the positive lead on the other wire terminal to the  solenoid and re-test to verify.  If there is no signal detected from the PCM, there may be a  fault with the PCM itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nCod eroare P0075 Peugeot 206Cine ma poate ajuta?Am un Peugeot 206 1.4 benzina din 2004,de o saptamana in timpul mersului apar intreruperi ca si cum asi opri motorul si la relantiv dupa 5 minute se opreste brusc apoi daca il pornesc din nou mai merge inca 5 minute....\u00a0Peugeot 407 P0480 P0075 P0267 P0273 P0264 P0081 P0443 P0204I'm in dire need of help.

    "Meaning": "P0076 Intake Valve Control Solenoid Circuit Low B1",
    "Common Causes": "On vehicles equipped with variable valve timing (VVT), the Engine Control Module / Powertrain Control Module (ECM/PCM) controls the camshaft position by regulating the engine oil through the control solenoid to change the position of the camshaft. The control solenoid is commanded using a Pulse Width Modulated signal (PWM) from the ECM/PCM.  The ECM/PCM monitors this signal and if the voltage is below specification, it will set this trouble code and illuminate the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL). \nBank 1 refers to the side of the engine with cylinder #1 - be sure to verify according to manufacturers specifications.  The intake valve control solenoid is usually located on the intake manifold side of the cylinder head. This code is similar to codes P0075 and P0077.

The solenoid can be ground side or power side controlled,  depending on the application.  Check with factory wiring diagrams to determine the power flow  in the circuit.  Using a digital volt ohm meter (DVOM) set to the volts setting, check for  voltage with the positive lead on the vehicle battery and the negative lead on each wire to  the control solenoid.  Depending on the application, if the solenoid is grounded to chassis,  test the power lead to the control solenoid at the PCM/ECM wiring harness, there should be no  voltage present.  If there is voltage present, check for a short to ground in the wiring up to  the control solenoid by unplugging connectors and working back to the solenoid.\nControl solenoid - Check for a short to ground through the control solenoid by putting either  DVOM lead to a known good ground and the other to each terminal on the control solenoid.  If  there is a low resistance present, the solenoid may be shorted internally.\nPCM/ECM - If all wiring and the control solenoid checks out okay, it will be necessary to  monitor the solenoid during engine operation by back probing the wires at the PCM/ECM.  Using  an advanced scan tool that will read the engine functions, monitor the duty cycle commanded  to the control solenoid.  It will be necessary to monitor the solenoid during engine  operation under various engine RPM's and load.  Using an oscilloscope or graphing multimeter  set to the duty cycle scale, connect the negative lead to a known good ground and the  positive lead to either wire terminal at the solenoid itself.  The reading on the multimeter  tool should match the commanded duty cycle on the scan tool.  If they are opposite, the  polarity may be reversed - connect the positive lead on the other wire terminal to the  solenoid and re-test to verify.  If there is no signal detected from the PCM, there may be a  fault with the PCM itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2015 Nissan Altima Error Code: P0076I recently got this error code P0776 (Pressure Control Solenoid B Perf/Off)\nI don't know anything about cars and was wondering is this going to be an expensive repair?\nAlso my car is only 54,000 miles and is this covered under the warranty?\nAny advice would be helpful.

  "P0088": {
    "Meaning": "P0088 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too High",
    "Common Causes": "Some vehicles are equipped with a returnless fuel supply, this means that the fuel pump is pulse width modulated and can vary in pump speed to deliver fuel to the rail at a varible rate instead of constantly running the fuel pump and regulating the pressure with a pressure regulator, returning fuel back to the tank.\nWhen a code P0088 is presented, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected a fuel rail pressure or fuel pressure sensor voltage input that exceeds maximum specifications. \nThe fuel rail pressure sensor is typically of the three-wire, piezoelectric variety.  Usually a 5-volt reference voltage signal and a ground signal are supplied to the sensor. As fuel pressure (at the sensor) increases, sensor resistance decreases. If five is maximum voltage to the sensor, and fuel pressure is at its lowest, sensor output should be approximately .5-volts, because sensor resistance is at its highest. As fuel pressure increases and sensor resistance decreases, the sensor signal voltage to the PCM should increase accordingly up to a maximum of 4.5-volts. These voltage figures are generic and you should consult the manufacturer\u2019s service manual for your vehicle prior to testing.\nThere is another fuel rail pressure sensor design that incorporates intake vacuum. Instead of monitoring fuel rail pressure directly, the sensor monitors the degree of intake manifold vacuum and sensor resistance is varied accordingly. The PCM receives the input voltage signal in much the same way as the straight fuel pressure sensor.\nIn yet another type of fuel rail pressure sensor, the fuel pressure regulator is integrated. The pressure sensor has no bearing on the regulation of fuel pressure to the fuel rail but the regulator may (or may not) be electronically regulated. Even if the fuel pressure regulator and sensor are integrated, the regulator may also be vacuum actuated.\nFuel rail pressure sensor voltage is received by the PCM, which adjusts fuel pump voltage to accomplish the desired amount of fuel rail pressure. This promotes more efficient fuel consumption.\nIf fuel rail pressure is higher than the amount programmed into the PCM, a P0088 will be stored and a service engine soon lamp may be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nSince excessive fuel pressure can lead to a wide variety of drivability issues and cause internal engine damage, a code P0088 should be investigated with some degree of urgency. Symptoms of a this engine code may include:\n\n Delayed startup, especially when the engine is cool \n Black smoke from the exhaust system \n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Spark plug fouling is possible in extreme circumstances \n Engine misfire codes and idle control codes may accompany a P0088\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0088 trouble code may include:\n\n Defective fuel pressure regulator\n Faulty fuel rail pressure sensor \n Shorted or open wiring and/or connectors in the fuel rail pressure sensor circuit \n A bad PCM or a PCM programming error\n\nPossible Solutions\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), a suitable fuel pressure gauge, and a manufacturer\u2019s service manual (or the equivalent) will prove instrumental in diagnosing a code P0088. \nNOTE: Please use caution when using a fuel pressure gauge under the hood of your vehicle. Fuel is under high pressure and fuel that comes into contact with hot surfaces or open spark could ignite and cause serious bodily injury.\nI like to begin with a visual inspection of system wiring and connectors. Pay particular attention to harnesses and components on top of the engine. The warmth and ease of access associated with this area makes it popular with pests, which tend to damage system wiring and connectors. Repair or replace defective or damaged wiring and/or connectors as required. I would also test battery voltage, battery cable connections, and alternator output at this time.\nIf intake manifold vacuum is utilized to control or monitor fuel rail pressure, intake manifold vacuum must be sufficient to accomplish the task. Consult a manufacturer\u2019s service manual for acceptable vacuum specifications for your vehicle and make sure that your engine complies.\nTest fuel system pressure using the fuel pressure gauge. Check the service manual for the exact fuel pressure specs that apply to your vehicle. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for using the fuel pressure gauge. \nIf the actual fuel pressure is greater than what is recommended by the manufacturer, suspect a fuel pressure regulator malfunction. If the fuel pressure is within specs, suspect a faulty fuel rail pressure sensor or fuel rail pressure sensor circuit.\nFollow the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines for testing the fuel rail pressure sensor and circuits with the DVOM. Disconnect controllers from the circuit before testing with the DVOM.\nAdditional diagnostic tips & notes:\n\n Fuel rail and related components are under high pressure. Use caution when removing the fuel pressure sensor or fuel pressure regulator \n Fuel pressure testing should be done with the ignition switch in the key on engine off (KOEO) position \n Turn the ignition switch off to connect/disconnect the fuel pressure gauge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nSprinter 3500 OBD code: P0088I have a 2011 sprinter van, it's showing a code of P0088 which i looked up and it's high fuel rail pressure.

If a fuel pressure test port is  unavailable, the fuel pressure can only be checked using an advanced scan tool or by splicing  adapter fittings in between the fuel lines and fuel rail.\nFuel pump - Fuel pump output is determined by the PCM/ECM and may be controlled by an  external fuel management computer.  The fuel pump may be duty cycle controlled on vehicles  with returnless fuel systems.  An advanced scan tool may be required to check the output on  these type of fuel systems.  Test the fuel pump for sufficient power by locating the fuel  pump wiring harness.  Some vehicles may be inaccessible to easily test the fuel pump wiring  connections.  Check for battery voltage at the positive terminal of the fuel pump using a  digital volt ohm meter set to the volts scale with the positive lead on the power wire and  the negative lead on a known good ground with the key in the on or run position.  The fuel  pump power wire may only be supplied voltage during engine cranking or vehicle running  condition.  Voltage displayed should be close to actual battery voltage.\nIf there is  insufficient power, suspect the wiring to the fuel pump and trace it back to determine if  there is any excessive resistance in the wiring, loose wires or loose/dirty connections.  On  return style fuel pumps, the ground can be checked using the DVOM set to ohms scale with  either lead on the ground wire and the other lead on a good known ground.  Resistance should  be very low.  On returnless style fuel systems, the trigger wire can be checked using a  graphing multimeter or oscilloscope set to the duty cycle scale.  Typically the duty cycle  from the fuel pump computer will be double what the computer commanded duty cycle is  commanded by the PCM/ECM.  Using the graphing multimeter or oscilloscope, the positive lead  will be tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a known good ground, it may be  necessary to determine which wire is correct by using a factory wiring diagram.  The actual  duty cycle should be about double what the PCM/ECM is commanding, if the duty cycle displayed  is half of the amount, the settings on the DVOM may need to be changed to accomodate the type  of duty cycle being tested.\nFuel lines - Look for physical damage or kinked fuel lines that would cause a restriction in  the fuel pump supply or return lines.  It may be necessary to remove the fuel filter to  determine if the fuel filter is clogged and needs to be replaced, it should flow freely in  the direction of flow indicated by an arrow on the fuel filter.  Some vehicles are not  equipped with fuel filters, and the filter is located on the inlet to the fuel pump itself,  it will be necessary to remove the fuel pump module to determine if there is a lot of debris  in the tank or if the fuel filter has been crushed or pinched which could also restrict fuel  supply to the pump.\nRegulator - On vehicles equipped with a return style fuel system, the regulator is usually  located on the fuel rail itself.  The fuel pressure regulator usually has a vacuum line that  will mechanically restrict fuel depending on the amount of vacuum supplied by the engine.   Check for damaged or loose vacuum hoses to the regulator.  If the vacuum hose has fuel inside  of it, the regulator may have an internal leak that would cause a pressure loss.  Using a  non-damaging clamp, the hose can be pinched off after the fuel pressure regulator - if the  fuel pressure is higher with a restriction on the return side of the regulator, the regulator  may be at fault.  On returnless systems, the fuel pressure regulator may be located inside of  the gas tank on the fuel pump module and it may be necessary to replace the fuel pump module  as a complete assembly.\nFuel pressure sensor - Test the fuel pressure sensor by removing the connector and checking  resistance across the terminals using the DVOM set to ohms scale with the positive and  negative lead on either of the connectors.  Resistance should be within factory  specifications.  Check for reference voltage to the fuel pressure sensor with a factory  wiring diagram to determine which wire supplies power to the sensor using the DVOM set to  volts scale with the positive lead on the supply wire and the negative lead on a known good  ground.  Voltage should be around 5 volts, depending on the vehicle.\nIf voltage is not  within specifications, trace the wiring back to determine if there is excessive resistance in  the wire supplying power to the sensor.  The signal wire can be checked using the DVOM set to  volts scale with the positive wire tapped into the signal wire and the negative lead on a  good known ground with the vehicle on and running.  The voltage displayed should match the  factory specifications depending on the outside temperature and the internal temperature of  the fuel inside the lines.  The PCM/ECM converts the voltage to a temperature to determine  actual fuel pressure.  It may be necessary to check the voltage at the PCM/ECM harness  connector as well to determine if there is a difference in voltage.  If the voltage at the  PCM/ECM is not the same as the voltage displayed at the fuel pressure sensor, there may be  excessive resistance in the wiring.\nUnplug the PCM/ECM harness connector and the fuel  pressure sensor connector to check for excessive resistance using the DVOM set to ohms scale  with either lead on each end of the harnesses.  Resistance should be very low, any excessive  resistance may be a fault with the wiring or there may be a short to power or ground present.   Look for a short to power by removing the PCM/ECM wiring harness connection with the DVOM  set to volts scale, with the positive lead on the pin for the fuel pressure signal and the  negative lead on a known good ground.  If the voltage is the same as reference or higher,  there may be a short to power and the wiring will need to be traced back to determine if  there is a short.  Check for a short to ground by setting the DVOM to the ohms scale with  either lead on the signal wire at the PCM/ECM harness connector and the other lead on a good  known ground.  If there is resistance present, there may be a short to ground and the wiring  will need to be traced back to determine where there is a short to ground.\nOther fuel pressure  trouble codes include:\n\nP0087 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too Low\nP0088 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too High\nP0190 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit\nP0191 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance\nP0192 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Low Input\nP0193 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit High Input\nP0194 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Intermittent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2010 Equinox P228D, P0016, P0017 & P0089 Reduced Engine Power, Service Stability Control System MessageI am getting Reduced Engine Power, Service Stability control System Message on 2010 Equinox Vin:2CNALBEW6A6221921.

  "P0090": {
    "Meaning": "P0090 Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Control Circuit Open",
    "Common Causes": "The electronic fuel pressure regulator is typically controlled by the PCM. A battery voltage signal and a ground signal are used to control a servo motor which positions a valve so that the desired level of fuel pressure can be achieved for any given set of circumstance. As voltage is applied to the electronic fuel pressure regulator servo motor, the valve is opened in small increments and fuel pressure is increased. When voltage is decreased, the servo retracts and a strong spring forces the valve to close; fuel pressure is decreased.\nThe fuel pressure sensor (usually located in the fuel injector rail) allows the PCM to monitor fuel pressure and adjust fuel pressure regulator voltage accordingly. \nThe fuel pressure regulator and fuel pressure sensor may be separate components but are most often integrated into a single housing which has one electrical connector.\nIf actual fuel pressure fails to comply with desired fuel pressure, as calculated by the PCM, a P0090 may be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated. \nRelated fuel pressure regulator engine codes:\n\nP0089 Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Performance\nP0091 Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Control Circuit Low\nP0092 Fuel Pressure Regulator 1 Control Circuit High\n\nSymptoms & Severity\nExcessive fuel pressure can lead to a variety of drivability issues, as well as causing internal engine and catalytic converter damage. For this reason a code P0090 should be classified as severe.\nSymptoms of a P0090 code may include:\n Delayed startup\nBlack smoke from the exhaust system\nDiminished fuel efficiency\nEngine drivability codes may also accompany a P0090\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Shorted or open wiring and/or connectors in the fuel pressure regulator control circuit\nDefective fuel pressure regulator\nFaulty fuel rail pressure sensor\nBad PCM or a PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), a suitable fuel pressure gauge, and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) will be necessary for diagnosing a code P0090. \nNOTE: Use extreme caution when connecting manual fuel pressure gauge. High pressure fuel that comes into contact with hot surfaces or open spark could ignite and cause a harmful vehicle fire.\nI normally start with a visual inspection of system wiring and connectors; focusing my attention on harnesses and connectors on top of the engine. The warmth associated with this area makes it popular with pests in cold climates.

Carefully follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for connecting the fuel pressure gauge. Observe fuel system data using the scanner while visually monitoring manual fuel pressure with the fuel gauge. If fuel pressure reflected on the scanner data display does not coincide with actual fuel pressure, suspect a faulty fuel pressure sensor. \nFluctuations in actual fuel pressure should occur with variations in fuel pressure regulator control voltage. If this is not the case, suspect that the fuel pressure regulator is defective, there is an open or shorted circuit in one of the fuel pressure regulator control circuits, or that the PCM is bad.\nFollow manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for testing the electronic fuel pressure regulator and the individual fuel pressure regulator control circuits with the DVOM.

Remember to follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for using the fuel pressure gauge. \nMonitor manual fuel pressure with the fuel gauge while using the scanner to observe fuel system data. A defective fuel pressure sensor may be at the root of your problems if the level of fuel pressure reflected on the scanner does not coincide with actual fuel pressure. Variations in fuel pressure regulator control voltage should reflect fluctuations in actual fuel rail pressure. If not, suspect that either the fuel pressure regulator is defective, there is an open or shorted circuit in one of the fuel pressure regulator control circuits, or that the PCM is bad.\nIn order to test the electronic fuel pressure regulator and the individual fuel pressure regulator control circuits, use the DVOM and follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Disconnect controllers from the circuit before testing circuit resistance and continuity with the DVOM.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nFuel rail and related components are under high pressure. Use caution when removing the fuel pressure sensor or fuel pressure regulator\nFuel pressure testing should be done with the ignition switch in the key on engine off (KOEO) position\n\nOther fuel pressure  trouble codes include:\n\nP0087 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too Low\nP0088 Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too High\nP0190 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit\nP0191 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Range/Performance\nP0192 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Low Input\nP0193 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit High Input\nP0194 Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor A Circuit Intermittent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0093": {
    "Meaning": "P0093 Fuel System Large Leak Detected",
    "Common Causes": "When the computer sets this  code it senses a large fuel leak in the high pressure section of the engine. The ECM in a diesel always monitors and controls the fuel pressure from the fuel injector pump to the injectors as long as the engine is running. \n To set a code P0093 the ECM must sense a sudden large drop in fuel pressure within the system. This drop in fuel pressure can be internal, external or caused by a faulty sensor signal to the ECM. \nWhen this happens, the ECM sets the code, goes into fail-safe mode which will suspend the fuel injector pump operation and allow one minute to pull over before it shuts the engine down. It will remain in fail-safe mode until the key is off. \nThe engine may run again but investigate the problem first. This problem will not correct itself or go away. The engine could shut down at any time or speed.\n Unlike gasoline engines with fuel injection pressures of 30 to 50 PSI, diesel engine fuel pressure runs up in the Megapascal range, from 4,500 to 30,000 PSI. It takes very high fuel pressure to force fuel into the high compression cylinder of a diesel.\nAs you progress in diagnosing the problem be always mindful of the fuel pressure when the engine is running. It is ridiculously high! You have a code P0093 stating there is a large fuel leak in the system. Use caution when sticking your nose under the hood of a running engine with this code, or wrenching on the fuel system.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0093 diagnostic trouble code may include:\n\nCode set and malfunction indicator lamp illumination (check engine light)\nEngine will enter fail-safe mode and shut down within one minute\nPossible large loss of power above idle\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this DTC include:\n\nFuel injector failure\nFuel line common rail leak\nFuel pressure sensor malfunction\nFuel pump or lift pump failure\nFuel heater constantly on\nFuel temperature sensor failure\nLeaks at any point in the high pressure circuit\nElectrical connector corrosion or seating problems\nFuel pressure regulator malfunction\nFuel filter plugged dropping the fuel line volume\nInjector pump leak\nFuel control actuator failure\nCascade overflow valve malfunction\nShort in the electrical harness at the injectors or to the ECM\nFuel pressure limiting valve \nECM failure\n\nDiagnostic Steps & Possible Solutions\n\nStart with the engine off and doing a walkaround inspection for obvious fuel leaks between the fuel tank and the engine.\nLift the hood and check the oil and level. If the oil level has risen, smell the oil. If it is heavily contaminated by fuel, an injector most likely failed in the open position. Do not start the engine again until the oil and filter is changed.\nLook under the hood for leaks. Start at the injector pump and follow the fuel lines to the fuel injector rail. Look at the injectors for signs of leaks.\nPull the electrical connector off the fuel pressure sensor and look for fuel in the connector. A failed sensor will allow fuel up through the sensor into the connector.\nCheck when you last changed the fuel filter. A plugged fuel filter will drop the volume enough to set the code.\nCheck all electrical connectors on the sensors and wiring harness to the injectors for missing insulation, corrosion or loose connections. If no obvious leaks have been found, go online and look up the TSBs (technical service bulletins) for your year and make vehicle. Diesels have no lack of problems as the TSBs will indicate. \n\nLook for the code and associated repair procedures and probable causes. Chevy and Dodge reads like a book. The TSBs will include recalls on various items as well. \nLook at your warranty. Most diesel engines have long warranty periods for various items. Many cover injectors for 7 years or better and 200,000 miles. \nThe dealer is the next step if no deficiencies are found. Checking the fuel pressure and the operation of the ECM takes special tools for a diagnosis.\nTip: Diesels outlast a normal gasoline powered engine when properly serviced. But they demand service at specific intervals to operate properly. There is no free lunch with these. Do not use any seals or gaskets that are not OEM. The pressures and temperatures call for the use of certain materials resistant to these temperatures and pressures. \nSee also: P0094 Fuel System Leak Detected - Small Leak\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\npeugeot 4007 2.2 p1351 p0087 p0093 p3003i have a peugeot 4007 2.2 2008, when the fuel is around a quarter full i have difficulty starting when hot or cold although it always starts, when the fuel level is above this level it starts normally, fault codes are p1351 p0087 p0093 p3003 which i believe are all fuel related, another slight fault...\u00a0P0093 code  on Toyota HiluxI keep getting a p0093 code on a 3.0 1KDFTV Toyota Hilux everytime the vehicle crosses 120kilometers per hour.

  "P0094": {
    "Meaning": "P0094 Fuel System Small Leak Detected",
    "Common Causes": "Diesel fuel systems are monitored (by the PCM) using one or more fuel pressure sensors. Low pressure fuel is pumped from the storage tank to the high pressure injector pump via a supply (or transfer) pump that is usually either attached to the frame rail or inside the fuel tank. Once the fuel exits the injector pump, it can reach levels as high as 2,500 psi. Use caution when testing fuel pressure. These extreme fuel pressure conditions can be very hazardous. Although diesel fuel is not as combustible as gasoline, it is highly flammable especially under high pressure. Additionally, diesel fuel under these levels of pressure can penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream. This can be harmful or even fatal under certain circumstances.\nFuel pressure sensors are placed at strategic locations in the fuel delivery system. Typically, there will be at least one fuel pressure sensor for each segment of the fuel system; a sensor for the low pressure supply end and another for the high pressure delivery end.\nThe fuel pressure sensors are normally of a three-wire design. Some manufacturers use battery voltage and others use a lesser degree of voltage (usually five-volts) as a reference for the PCM. Reference voltage and a ground signal are supplied to the sensor. The sensor provides the PCM with a voltage input signal. As fuel system pressure increases, the resistance level of the fuel pressure sensor decreases, allowing the voltage signal that is input to the PCM to increase accordingly. When fuel pressure decreases, resistance levels in the fuel pressure sensor increase, causing the voltage input signal to the PCM to decrease. If the fuel pressure sensor/s is operating normally, this cycle takes effect with each ignition cycle.\nIf the PCM detects fuel system pressure that does not coincide with programmed specifications, during a set period of time and under certain circumstances, a code P0094 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\n\nSeverity & Symptoms\nGiven the potential for a vehicle fire, as well as the distinct possibility of diminished fuel efficiency that can be associated with a stored P0094 code, it should be addressed with a great degree of urgency.\nSymptoms of a P0094 code may include:\n\n The distinct smell of diesel fuel \n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Decreased engine performance \n Other fuel system codes may be stored\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Clogged fuel filter \n Defective fuel pressure sensor \n Faulty fuel pressure regulator \n Fuel system leaks that may include: fuel tank,\tlines, injection pump, supply pump, fuel injectors\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nI would gain access to a suitable diagnostic scanner, a diesel fuel pressure gauge, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a vehicle service manual or a subscription to All Data (DIY), when attempting to diagnose a code of this type.\nI typically begin my diagnosis with a visual inspection of fuel lines and components. If any leaks are discovered, repair them and recheck the system. Inspect system wiring and connectors at this time.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve al stored codes and freeze frame data. Write this information down in case this proves to be an intermittent code, which will prove much more difficult to diagnose. If other fuel system related codes are present, you may want to diagnose them first before attempting to diagnose the P0094. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle.\nIf the P0094 is immediately reset, locate the data stream of the scanner and observe fuel pressure readings. By narrowing the data stream to include only pertinent data, you will get a quicker response. Compare the actual reflected fuel pressure readings with manufacturer\u2019s specifications.\nIf fuel pressure is not within specs, use the fuel pressure gauge to test system pressure in the appropriate quadrant. If actual fuel pressure readings are not within manufacturer\u2019s recommended specifications, suspect a mechanical failure. Continue by disconnecting the fuel pressure sensor connector and testing the resistance of the sensor itself. If the sensor resistance does not comply with manufacturer\u2019s specifications, replace it and retest the system.\nIf the sensor checks out, disconnect all related controllers and begin testing system circuits for resistance and continuity. Repair or replace shorted or open circuits as required. \nIf all system sensors and circuitry seems normal, suspect a defective PCM or PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic tips:\n\n Use caution when testing high pressure fuel systems. These types of systems should only be serviced by qualified personnel \n Despite this code being described as a \"small leak\"  low fuel pressure is often the culprit \n\nSee also: P0093 Fuel System Leak Detected - Large Leak\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0095": {
    "Meaning": "P0095 IAT Sensor 2 Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "As air passes over the sensor the resistance changes. This change in resistance affects the 5 Volts supplied to the sensor accordingly. Colder air causes higher resistance and higher signal voltage & warmer air lower resistance and lower signal voltage. The PCM monitors this change in the 5 Volts and calculates air temperature. If the PCM detects a voltage that is out of normal operating range for the #2 sensor, P0095 will set. \nSymptoms\nThere may be no noticeable symptoms other than MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination. However, it could be possible that you may experience poor drivability complaints. \nCauses\nPotential causes of the P0095 DTC include: \n\nIAT sensor shifted out of airflow\nBad IAT sensor #2\nShorted to ground or open on signal circuit to IAT\nOpen in ground circuit to IAT\nPoor connection at IAT (backed out terminals, broken connector locks, etc.)\nBad PCM \n\nPossible Solutions\nFirst visually check that the IAT is in place and hasn't been dislodged. As a quick check of the IAT, use a scan tool & check for IAT reading with KOEO (Key on engine off). If the engine is cold, the IAT reading should be the same as the CTS (Coolant temperature sensor) reading. If it shows more than a few degrees variance (for example, if it indicates a temperature extreme like negative 40 deg. or 300 deg. then obviously there's a problem) unplug the IAT and do a resistance test across the two terminals.\nEach sensor will have different resistances so you'll have to get that info from a repair manual. If the resistance of the IAT sensor isn't within specs, replace the sensor. There should be some resistance, so if it measures infinite resistance, replace the sensor.\nHaving said that, here is a little more diagnostic info if that doesn't take care of it:\n1. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the high extreme, like 300 deg. (which obviously is inaccurate), disconnect the IAT sensor. If the reading now shows the lowest extreme (-50 or so), then replace the IAT sensor. However, if when unplugging the IAT, the reading doesn't change then turn off the ignition and disconnect the PCM connector. Use a voltmeter to check for continuity between a good ground and the signal wire to the IAT. If there is continuity, then repair short to ground on the signal wire. If there is not continuity, then the PCM may have a problem\n2. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the low extreme, again disconnect the IAT connector. Check that there is 5 Volts on the signal and the other is grounded.\na. If you have 5 volts present and a good ground, jumper the two terminals together. Now the reading on the scanner should be at the high extreme. If it is, replace the IAT sensor. But if it stays low even after you jumper the two wires together, then there may be an open in the wiring harness or a problem with the PCM.\nb. If you don't have 5 Volts present, then check for reference voltage back at the PCM connector. If it's present there but not at the IAT sensor, repair the open in the signal wire. \nOther IAT sensor and circuit related trouble codes:  P0096, P0097, P0098, P0099, P0110, P0111, P0112, P0113, P0114, P0127\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2010 ford focus 1.6 diesel with both underboost and overboost erros P0234, P0299, P0095Hi\nMy 2010 ford focus has recently had a new turbo installed and has done roughly 300 miles since them, but now i am receiving 3 error codes P0234, P0299 and P0095.

This code means that the PCM saw a larger-than-normal change in a shorter-than-expected time on the #2 IAT signal circuit. \nSymptoms\nSince this code is likely pointing to an intermittent problem on the IAT circuit, there may not be any symptoms at present. However, the MIL will likely be on. The car MAY exhibit some drivability problems, but it is more likely that there will be no noticeable symptoms to the driver.\nCauses\nPotential causes of the P0096 DTC include: \n\na bad #2 IAT sensor\nan open in the signal or ground circuit\na short to ground on the signal circuit\npoor connection at sensor or PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf there are other IAT codes present, diagnose them first. If not, then, using a scan tool verify the IAT voltage with KOEO (Key on engine off).\nIf, on a cold engine it reads the same as the CTS (Coolant temperature sensor), then the problem is intermittent. But if the IAT reading isn't the same as the CTS refer to diagnostic procedure for P0110. If your scan tool has a freeze frame failure records feature, use it to see what the IAT reading was at the time of the failure. If the reading was at negative 30 or so degrees F (indicating it was at the extreme coldest reading), then there was an intermittent high resistance reading on the IAT signal circuit.\nCheck for an open ground on the ground circuit and signal circuit. If they are OK, try raising and lowering the temperature of the IAT sensor artificially. Do this by removing the IAT and putting it in a freezer and then applying heat with a heat gun (be careful not to apply too much heat to the IAT with the heat gun or it'll melt the sensor). Watch the resistance change using an ohmmeter attached to each terminal. It should vary smoothly with no sudden jumps. If the reading jumps suddenly, then repace the IAT sensor.\nHowever if the freeze frame reading was at the highest extreme (above 250 deg. F) then there was an intermittent low resistance on the signal circuit. Check for a short to ground on the signal circuit. If it appears OK, then do the above artificial heat test and replace the IAT as necessary. If the problem can't be duplicated, use a voltmeter to watch the signal voltage as you \"wiggle\" test the wiring harness. Watch for a sudden change in voltage indicating a short or open. Replace IAT as necessary.\nThis is a pretty simple code and it only really looks for extremely short changes that are relatively high in voltage.

    "Common Causes": "To keep these higher temps\n  from causing increased combustion temps, the intake air tubing should be intact,\n  allowing the engine to \"breathe\" air that isn't sampled from the engine\n  compartment.  The IAT sensor measures air temp by using a thermistor, or a thermometer of\n  sorts.  The thermistor is supplied 5 volts reference voltage from the PCM\n  (powertrain control module) and a ground.  Usually, when the air temperature is cold\n  the resistance in the thermistor is high and when the air temperature is warmer, the\nresistance decreases.  \nThis change in resistance changes the 5 V reference from the\n  PCM, thereby informing the PCM of the temperature of incoming air.

    "Meaning": "P0099 IAT Circuit Sensor 2 Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM uses the IAT input signal and the mass airflow (MAF) sensor input signal to calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing strategy. Since maintaining a correct air/fuel ratio (typically 14:1) is critical to engine performance and fuel efficiency, the input of the IAT sensor is very important.\nThe IAT sensor can be threaded directly into the intake manifold but is more commonly inserted into the air inlet pipe or air cleaner box. Some manufacturers also integrate the IAT sensor into the MAF sensor housing. At any rate, it must be positioned so that (with the engine running) ambient air, drawn into the intake manifold through the throttle body, can continuously and consistently flow across it. \nThe IAT sensor is usually a two-wire thermistor sensor. Sensor resistance varies according to the temperature of the air that flows across the cold wire element. Most OBD II equipped vehicles utilize a reference voltage (five-volts is normal) and a ground signal to complete the IAT sensor circuit. The varying resistance levels in the IAT sensor element cause voltage fluctuations in the input circuit. These fluctuations are interpreted by the PCM as changes in intake air temperature.\nIf the PCM detects a certain number of intermittent signals from the #2 IAT sensor, over a set period of time, a code P0099 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\n\nSeverity & Symptoms\nThe IAT sensor signal is used by the PCM to calculate fuel delivery strategy, therefore a code P0099 should be treated as severe.\nSymptoms of a P0099 code may include:\n\n Slightly diminished fuel efficiency \n Decreased engine performance (especially upon cold start) \n Hesitation or surge at idle or upon light acceleration \n Other drivability codes may be stored\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Open or shorted #2 IAT sensor wiring and/or connectors \n Defective #2 IAT sensor \n Faulty MAF sensor \n Clogged air filter \n Broken intake air inlet pipe\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nWhen faced with diagnosing a code P0099, I like to have a suitable diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), an infrared thermometer, and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) at my disposal.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve the stored trouble codes and applicable freeze frame data. I normally write this information down in case I need it later. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle. If the code is immediately reset, proceed with the diagnostic process.\nMost professional technicians begin with a visual inspection of IAT sensor related wiring and connectors (don\u2019t forget the air filter and the air inlet pipe). Pay careful attention to the sensor connector as it is susceptible to corrosion because of its close proximity to the battery and coolant reservoir.\nIf the system wiring, connectors, and components appear to be in working order, proceed by connecting the scanner to the diagnostic connector and opening the data stream. By narrowing the data stream to include only pertinent data, you will get a faster response. Use the infrared thermometer to make sure that the IAT reading (on the scanner) correctly reflects actual intake air temperature.\nIf it is incorrect, consult your vehicle information source for IAT sensor testing recommendations. Use the DVOM to test the sensor and compare your findings with vehicle specifications. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply. \nIf the sensor passes the resistance test, check for a sensor reference voltage and a ground. If either one of these are not present repair the open or shorted circuit and retest the system. If system reference and ground signals are present, obtain an IAT sensor voltage to temperature chart from your vehicle information source and use the DVOM to test sensor output voltage. Compare the voltage with the voltage to temperature chart and replace the sensor if actual findings vary from maximum recommended tolerances.\nIf actual IAT input voltage is within specifications, disconnect the electrical connector/s from all related controllers and use the DVOM to test resistance and continuity on all system circuits. Repair or replace circuits that prove to be open or shorted and retest the system.\nIf the IAT sensor and all system circuits are within recommended specifications, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nBy far, the most common cause of a P0099 being stored is a disconnected #2 IAT sensor connector. When the air filter is checked or replaced, the IAT sensor is often left disconnected. If your vehicle has recently been service, and a code P0099 is suddenly stored, suspect that the IAT sensor has simply been left unplugged.\n\nRelated IAT sensor and circuit trouble codes: P0095, P0096, P0097, P0098, P0110, P0111, P0112, P0113, P0114, P0127\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

Inspect for any vacuum leaks downstream\n  of the MAF sensor.\nUse a scan tool to monitor real-time sensor values from the MAF sensor, O2 sensors, etc.\nCheck for Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) for your particular make/model in case of known issues on your vehicle\n The barometric pressure (BARO) that is used in order to calculate the predicted \n    MAF value is initially based on the MAP sensor \n  at key ON. \n A high resistance on the ground circuit of the MAP \n    sensor can cause this DTC to set\n\nIf you do need to replace the MAF sensor, we recommend using an original equipment OEM one from the manufacturer rather than buying an aftermarket part.\n Note: The use of a reusable oiled air filter could be a cause of this code, if it is over-oiled. Oil can transfer to the fine wire or film inside the MAF sensor and contaminate it. Use something such as MAF cleaner spray to clean the MAF in such situations. We do not recommend the use of oiled air filters.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2003 Dakota 3.9l 4x4 P0100I am getting this code but it is not valid for my truck..

  "P0105": {
    "Meaning": "P0105 - MAP Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "An engine under load has more manifold pressure(or less vacuum) than an engine that is coasting.  As the load changes, the MAP sensor voltage signal to the PCM changes accordingly.  To check the MAP sensor operation, though, the PCM watches other sensors to verify that the MAP sensor is working properly.\nFor example, the PCM compares the TPS (Throttle Position Sensor) signal to the MAP signal to verify the MAP signal isn't \"sticking\".  If the PCM doesn't see a MAP sensor change immediately follow a change in the throttle pedal sensor, it knows there is a problem with the MAP sensor and sets P0105.  Or, if the PCM notices that the TPS indicates the engine is under load, but the MAP signal indicates that the engine is \"coasting\" it, again, knows there is a problem with the MAP sensor or TPS and sets P0105.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0105 check engine light code may include:\n\nPoor running engine\nEngine runs rich\nEngine won't idle\nEngine backfires through tailpipe\nEngine misfire under load or at idle\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nIn some extreme cases there may be no symptoms other than MIL illumination\n\n\n  A typical MAP sensor\n\nCauses\nA P0105 DTC could be caused by:\n\nMAP sensor vacuum hose disconnected or plugged\nBad MAP sensor\nBad TPS\nDamaged or problematic MAP sensor connector\nDamaged or problematic TPS connector\nDamaged wiring\nShort to reference voltage on signal circuit of MAP sensor\nLoss of ground to MAP sensor or TPS\nOpen on signal circuit of MAP sensor\nBad PCM \n\nPossible Solutions\nUsing a scanner or code reader, turn the ignition on and engine OFF; what does the MAP sensor voltage read?  It should be about 4 Volts for sea level.  If you are at a higher altitude, it should decrease about half a volt or so for each 1,000 ft. of altitude (this will vary from model to model)  Or if you have a separate MAF (Mass air flow) sensor on your vehicle, they are usually equipped with a Barometric pressure reading.  If so, the Baro reading should match the MAP reading (they both measure ambient air pressure).  If they're roughly equal, then, check for Freeze Frame data of the MAP sensor (if available).\nNOTE:  Freeze Frame data is the PCM recording a fault when it happens.  It captures the readings of the various PIDS (parameter identifiers)available to troubleshoot what happened.  It's like a recording of the problem as it happened.  At idle a typical MAP sensor Voltage reading should be about a volt, and at WOT (wide open throttle) it should approach 4.5 to 5 Volts.  As for the TPS, at idle, the voltage reading is about 1 Volt or less.  As the throttle is opened the reading will increase to 4.5 Volts at WOT.  Do the two readings make sense?  For example, if the TPS reading on Freeze Frame data shows 2.5 Volts (indicating partial throttle) does the MAP sensor indicate a reading that isn't at either extreme?  Using the Freeze Frame data (if available) compare the MAP reading to the TPS when the problem occurred.  This can help you identify what happened\n If you have no access to Freeze Frame data then check if the MAP sensor voltage changes when you apply vacuum to it. You can do this by mouth or a vacuum pump.  The voltage should increase as you apply vacuum.  If the reading doesn't change as you apply vacuum, make sure there are no obstructions in the hose to the sensor.  If the hose is clear, the MAP sensor is usually bad, but it doesn't rule out the following from causing the problem: Does the MAP sensor appear to be stuck at less than .5 Volts?  Then:\nNOTE:  This code shouldn't set if the MAP is stuck at extremely low voltage, however, I'm adding it in because there's no way to know for certain for which vehicles a low voltage condition may set a P0105.\n\nInspect the wiring harness and MAP sensor connector.  Repair any damage\nUnplug the MAP sensor connector.  Also, at the PCM connector, remove the MAP sensor signal wire and check for continuity to the MAP sensor connector.  If there is infinite resistance, then repair open in MAP signal circuit. If the signal wire has continuity to the MAP sensor connector, then check for 5 volt reference voltage to the connector and a good ground.  If both are present, then re-install all removed wiring and replace the MAP sensor.\n\nDoes the MAP sensor appear to be stuck at full 4.5 voltage? Then:\n\nInspect the wiring harness for damage.  Repair as needed\nRemove the MAP sensor signal wire from the PCM connector.  With a voltmeter measure the voltage with KEY ON ENGINE OFF.  Is there 4.5 Volts?  If so, unplug the MAP sensor and recheck.  If it is still present, then repair short between the signal wire and 5 volt reference wire.\n If unplugging the MAP sensor causes the voltage to disappear, check that the ground is intact.  If it is, then replace the MAP sensor due to internal short.\n\nMAP sensor codes include P0106, P0107, P0108 and P0109.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n'99 Nissan Quest P0105-P0325-P1605-P0446-P1400-P1705 andmoreHowdy all of you,\n\nI have a problem (maybe more than one) that I am trying to troubleshoot on my Nissan Quest '99 GXE (111 000 km/69,000 mi).

If the PCM doesn't see any of these factors change while detecting \n  a rapid change in MAP value, it will set a P0106.\n\n  A typical MAP sensor\n\nPotential Symptoms\nThe following could be symptomatic of a P0106:\n\n Engine runs rough\n Black smoke at tailpipe\n Engine will not idle\n Poor fuel economy\n Engine misses at speed\n\nCauses\nA P0106 could be caused by:\n\n Bad MAP sensor\n Water/dirt intrusion affecting MAP sensor \n    connector\n Intermittent open in the reference, ground, or signal wire for the MAP \n    sensor\n Intermittent short in the reference, ground, or signal wire for the MAP \n    sensor\n Ground problem due to corrosion causing intermittent signal problem\nA break in the flexible air intake duct between the MAF and the intake manifold\n Bad PCM (do not assume the PCM is bad until you've exhausted all other \n    possibilities)\n\nPossible Solutions\nUsing a scan tool, watch the MAP sensor value \n  with the key on, engine off. Compare the BARO reading with the MAP reading. \n  They should be roughly equal. The voltage for the MAP sensor should read approx. \n  4.5 volts. Now start the engine and look for a significant drop in the MAP sensor \n  voltage indicating the MAP sensor is working.\nIf the MAP reading doesn't change perform the following:\n\n With the Key on, engine off, disconnect the vacuum hose from the MAP sensor. \n    Using a vacuum pump, pull 20 in. of vacuum on the MAP sensor. Does the voltage \n    drop? It should. If it doesn't inspect the MAP sensor vacuum port and vacuum \n    hose to manifold for a restriction of some kind. Repair or replace as necessary.\nIf there are no restrictions, and the value doesn't change with vacuum, \n    then perform the following: with the Key on and engine off and the MAP sensor \n    unplugged, check for 5 Volts at the reference wire to the MAP sensor connector \n    with a Digital Voltmeter. If there is none, check for reference voltage at \n    the PCM connector. If the reference voltage is present at the PCM connector \n    but not the MAP connector, check for open or short in the reference wire between \n    MAP and PCM and retest.\nIf reference voltage is present, then check for existing ground at the MAP \n    sensor connector. If it isn't present then repair open/short in the ground \n    circuit.\nIf ground is present, then replace MAP sensor.\n\nOther  MAP sensor trouble codes include P0105, P0107, P0108 and P0109.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nreduced power 2008 chevy avalanche p0420, p0430,p0106, p069e, p1682, c0035, c0561, c0899,c0900, and p0573Having some check engine light issues and after reading about this on various sites it sounds like it can get costly and tricky..

  "P0107": {
    "Meaning": "P0107 - Manifold Absolute Pressure/Barometric Pressure Circuit Low Input",
    "Common Causes": "Inside the MAP \n  sensor is a resistor that moves in relation to manifold pressure. The resistor \n  varies the voltage between about 1 volt to 4.5 volts (depending on engine load) \n  and that voltage signal is returned to the PCM to indicate manifold pressure \n  (vacuum). This signal is essential for the PCM to determine fuel delivery. A \n  P0107 DTC is set when the PCM sees that the MAP signal voltage is less than \n  .25 volts which is too low.\n\n  A typical MAP sensor\n\nPotential Symptoms\nAnytime the MAP sensor signal is low the \n  vehicle will likely have a very difficult time starting. Other symptoms may \n  include:\n\n Hard to start\n Long cranking times\n Sputtering/missing\n Blowing black smoke\n Poor fuel economy\n Dies intermittently\n MIL(Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\n\nCauses\nThe causes of a low MAP sensor signal circuit (P0107) \n  could be any of the following:\n\n Bad MAP sensor\n Open or short in the signal circuit\n Open or short in the 5 Volt reference circuit\n Ground circuit open or shorted\n Bad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nFirst, using a scan tool with the Key on and engine running, monitor the MAP \n  sensor voltage. If it is reading less than .5 volts, turn engine off, unplug \n  the MAP sensor and, using a DVOM (Digital Volt/Ohm Meter) check for 5Volts on \n  the 5 Volt reference circuit.\n1. If there is not 5 Volts on the reference circuit, then check for the reference \n  voltage at the PCM connector. If it is present at the PCM connector but not \n  the MAP connector, repair the open in the reference circuit between the PCM \n  and MAP harness connector. If 5 Volt reference is NOT present at the PCM connector, \n  check powers and grounds of PCM and repair/replace as needed. (NOTE: On Chrysler \n  products, a shorted Crank sensor, Vehicle speed sensor or any other sensor that \n  utilizes the 5 Volt reference from the PCM can short out the 5 Volt reference. \n  To fix simply unplug each sensor one at a time until the 5 Volt reference reappears. \n  The last sensor unplugged is the shorted sensor.)\n2. If you have a 5 Volt reference at the MAP connector, jumper the 5 volt reference \n  circuit to the signal circuit. Now check the MAP voltage on the scan tool. It \n  should be 4.5 to 5 Volts. If it is, replace MAP sensor. If not, repair open/short \n  in the signal circuit wiring and re-check.\n3. If all appears okay, perform a wiggle test. Start engine and manipulate \n  the harness, connector and tap on the MAP sensor. Note any changes in voltage \n  or engine speed. Repair connector, harness, or sensor as needed.\n4. If the wiggle test checks out, use a vacuum pump (or just use your lungs) \n  to draw a vacuum on the MAP sensor vacuum port. As you add vacuum the voltage \n  should decrease. With no vacuum, the MAP sensor should read approximately 4.5 \n  volts. If there is no change in MAP sensor reading on the scan tool, replace \n  MAP sensor.\nMAP Sensor DTC's: P0105, P0106, P0108 and P0109.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n99 s-10 how to read voltages on MAP sensor?

    "Meaning": "P0108 - MAP Pressure Circuit High Input",
    "Common Causes": "The higher the engine vacuum, the lower the voltage reading. The voltage should range between about 1 volt (at idle) to about 5 volts (WOT wide open throttle).\nIf the PCM sees the voltage reading from the MAP sensor is greater than 5 Volts, or if the voltage reading is higher than what the PCM considers normal under certain circumstances, a P0108 DTC will set. \n\n  A typical MAP sensor\n\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0108 DTC code may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) will likely be on\nEngine may run poorly\nEngine may not run at all\nFuel mileage may decrease\nPresence of black smoke at exhaust\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0108 code:\n\nBad MAP sensor\nLeak in vacuum supply line to MAP sensor\nEngine vacuum leak\nShort on signal wire to PCM\nShort on reference voltage wire from PCM\nOpen in ground circuit to MAP\nWorn engine causing low vacuum \n\nPossible Solutions\nA good way to diagnose if the MAP sensor is to blame would be to compare the KOEO (key on engine off) MAP sensor reading on a scan tool with the Barometric pressure reading. They should be the same because they both measure atmospheric pressure.\nIf the MAP reading is greater than 0.5 volt off of the BARO reading, then replacing the MAP sensor would likely fix the problem. Otherwise, start the engine and observe the MAP reading at idle. It should normally be about 1.5 volts (varies according to altitude).\na. If it is, the problem is likely intermittent. Check all the vacuum hoses for damage and replace as necessary. You can also try wiggle testing the harness and connector to reproduce the problem.\nb. If the scan tool MAP reading is more than 4.5 volts, check the actual engine vacuum reading with the engine running. If it is less than 15 or 16 in. Hg, then the PCM is probably not seeing enough vacuum (due to a worn engine, perhaps) for a given operating condition (which causes a higher than normal voltage signal to the PCM) and setting the code. Repair the engine vacuum problem and retest.\nc. But, if the actual engine vacuum reading is 16 in. Hg or more, then unplug the MAP sensor. The scan tool MAP reading should indicate that there is no voltage present. Check that the ground from the PCM is intact and also that the MAP sensor connector and terminals are tight. If the connection is good, then replace the map sensor.\nd. However if, with KOEO, & the MAP sensor unplugged, the scan tool shows a voltage reading, then there may be a short in the harness to the MAP sensor. Turn the ignition off. At the PCM unplug connector and remove the MAP signal wire from the connector. Re-attach the PCM connector and see if with KOEO, the scan tool MAP reading shows voltage. If it still does, replace the PCM. If not, check for voltage on the signal wire you just removed from the PCM. If there is voltage on the signal wire, find the short in the harness and repair. \nOther MAP Sensor codes: P0105 - P0106 - P0107 - P0109\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n99 s-10 how to read voltages on MAP sensor?

  "P0109": {
    "Meaning": "P0109 MAP / Baro Pressure Circuit Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "The MAP sensor is designed to enable the PCM to monitor variations in atmospheric pressure using absolute intake manifold pressure. Atmospheric pressure is directly related to the particular degree of altitude, as it applies to your vehicle. The MAP sensor is usually supplied with a reference voltage (5-volt) signal, a battery ground, and one (or more) output signal circuit/s. \nMAP sensor resistance levels react to changes in absolute manifold pressure. Changing resistance levels in the MAP sensor create variations in sensor output voltage to the PCM. These varying voltage signals are not only used by the PCM to calaculate fuel delivery and ignition timing, but also compared with programmed specifications.\nIf input voltage fails to comply with programmed specifications, under certain circumstances for a set period of time, a P0109 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nThere are several different system of monitoring manifold absolute/barometric pressure. Consult your vehicle service manual or All Data (DIY) to determine the exact MAP sensor design of your vehicle.\n\n  An example of a MAP sensor\n\nSeveral manufacturers use a MAP sensor and a separate barometric pressure sensor. In this case, the MAP sensor is mounted away from the engine and has a vacuum hose connected to it. The degree of engine intake vacuum is gathered by the sensor and input to the PCM, where it is compared with the input signal from the barometric pressure sensor, intake air temperature, and other factors to determine actual altitude (elevation above sea level). If the MAP sensor and BPS input signals vary by more than the specified degree, a P0109 will be stored and a MIL illuminated.\nMost automakers integrate the MAP sensor with the BPS. In this type of system, the sensor is mounted to the engine intake manifold. The scanner data stream may reflect only manifold absolute pressure instead of MAP and barometric pressure for this type of system.\n\nSeverity & Symptoms\nSince the conditions that cause a P0109 to be stored will likely lead to very poor fuel efficiency and engine drivability issues, this code should be addressed urgently.\nSymptoms of a P0109 code may include:\n\n Hesitation on acceleration \n General lack of engine performance \n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Black smoke from exhaust \n Excessively rich fuel exhaust fumes\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Defective MAP sensor\n Open or shorted wiring for the MAP sensor and/or the BPS \n Faulty BPS \n Corroded connector face at the MAP/BPS sensor \n Defective PCM or PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nTools that I would likely use to diagnose a P0109 are a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter, a vacuum gauge, and a vehicle service manual (or online service such as All Data DIY).\nI like to begin my diagnosis with a visual inspection of system related wiring harnesses and connectors. Corroded connector faces and damaged wiring must be rectified before proceeding with the diagnostic process.\nConnect the scanner to the diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Make a note of this information. It may prove useful in the event that the P0109 is an intermittent code. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle.\nAn engine vacuum test can help to ensure that the engine is making sufficient vacuum. Consult your vehicle information source for minimum engine vacuum specifications. Poorly running engines will not produce sufficient vacuum for the MAP sensor. Ignition misfire codes should be diagnosed and repaired before attempting to diagnose a P0109. Clogged catalytic converters, restricted mufflers, and low fuel pressure may also contribute to insufficient engine vacuum.\nIf a P0109 is immediately reset, and all circuits and connectors appear to be in order, continue testing at the MAP sensor. Follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for testing the MAP sensor. Use the DVOM to test resistance of the MAP sensor. If the MAP sensor fails to comply with resistance specifications, replace it. To prevent damage to related controllers, disconnect them before testing resistance levels in system circuits with the DVOM. Repair or replace open or shorted circuits as required.\nSuspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error if the sensor and all circuits are compliant with manufacturer\u2019s specifications.\nOther MAP Sensor engine codes include P0105, P0106, P0107, and P0108.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0110": {
    "Meaning": "P0110  IAT Sensor 1 Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "As air passes over the sensor the resistance changes. This change in resistance affects the 5 Volts supplied to the sensor accordingly. Colder air causes higher resistance and higher signal voltage & warmer air lower resistance and lower signal voltage. The PCM monitors this change in the 5 Volts and calculates air temperature. If the PCM detects a voltage that is out of normal operating range for the sensor, P0110 will set. \nSymptoms\nThere may be no noticeable symptoms other than MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination. However, it could be possible that you may experience poor drivability complaints. \nCauses\nPotential causes of the P0110 DTC include: \n\nIAT sensor shifted out of airflow\nBad IAT sensor\nShorted to ground or open on signal circuit to IAT\nOpen in ground circuit to IAT\nPoor connection at IAT (backed out terminals, broken connector locks, etc.)\nBad PCM \n\nPossible Solutions\nFirst visually check that the IAT is in place and hasn't been dislodged. As a quick check of the IAT, use a scan tool & check for IAT reading with KOEO (Key on engine off). If the engine is cold, the IAT reading should be the same as the CTS (Coolant temperature sensor) reading. If it shows more than a few degrees variance (for example, if it indicates a temperature extreme like negative 40 deg. or 300 deg. then obviously there's a problem) unplug the IAT and do a resistance test across the two terminals.\nEach sensor will have different resistances so you'll have to get that info from a repair manual. If the resistance of the IAT sensor isn't within specs, replace the sensor. There should be some resistance, so if it measures infinite resistance, replace the sensor.\nHaving said that, here is a little more diagnostic info if that doesn't take care of it:\n1. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the high extreme, like 300 deg. (which obviously is inaccurate), disconnect the IAT sensor. If the reading now shows the lowest extreme (-50 or so), then replace the IAT sensor. However, if when unplugging the IAT, the reading doesn't change then turn off the ignition and disconnect the PCM connector. Use a voltmeter to check for continuity between a good ground and the signal wire to the IAT. If there is continuity, then repair short to ground on the signal wire. If there is not continuity, then the PCM may have a problem\n2. If your KOEO IAT reading is at the low extreme, again disconnect the IAT connector. Check that there is 5 Volts on the signal and the other is grounded.\na. If you have 5 volts present and a good ground, jumper the two terminals together. Now the reading on the scanner should be at the high extreme. If it is, replace the IAT sensor. But if it stays low even after you jumper the two wires together, then there may be an open in the wiring harness or a problem with the PCM.\nb. If you don't have 5 Volts present, then check for reference voltage back at the PCM connector. If it's present there but not at the IAT sensor, repair the open in the signal wire. \nOther IAT sensor and circuit related DTCs: P0095, P0096, P0097, P0098, P0099, P0111, P0112, P0113, P0114, P0127\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2006 Toyota RAV4 P0113, p0110While troubleshooting p0355 I removed and blew out air filter during reassembly and added p110 and 0113 to list of existing codes.

  "P0111": {
    "Meaning": "P0111 IAT Sensor 1 Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "When the intake air is warm, the reistance is low, resulting in a low signal voltage. This code means that the PCM saw a larger-than-normal change in a shorter-than-expected time on the IAT signal circuit. \nSymptoms\nSince this code is likely pointing to an intermittent problem on the IAT circuit, there may not be any symptoms at present. However, the MIL will likely be on. The car MAY exhibit some drivability problems, but it is more likely that there will be no noticeable symptoms to the driver.\nCauses\nPotential causes of the P0111 DTC include: \n\na bad IAT sensor\nan open in the signal or ground circuit\na short to ground on the signal circuit\npoor connection at sensor or PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf there are other IAT codes present, diagnose them first. If not, then, using a scan tool verify the IAT voltage with KOEO (Key on engine off).\nIf, on a cold engine it reads the same as the CTS (Coolant temperature sensor), then the problem is intermittent. But if the IAT reading isn't the same as the CTS refer to diagnostic procedure for P0110. If your scan tool has a freeze frame failure records feature, use it to see what the IAT reading was at the time of the failure. If the reading was at negative 30 or so degrees F (indicating it was at the extreme coldest reading), then there was an intermittent high resistance reading on the IAT signal circuit.\nCheck for an open ground on the ground circuit and signal circuit. If they are OK, try raising and lowering the temperature of the IAT sensor artificially. Do this by removing the IAT and putting it in a freezer and then applying heat with a heat gun (be careful not to apply too much heat to the IAT with the heat gun or it'll melt the sensor). Watch the resistance change using an ohmmeter attached to each terminal. It should vary smoothly with no sudden jumps. If the reading jumps suddenly, then repace the IAT sensor.\nHowever if the freeze frame reading was at the highest extreme (above 250 deg. F) then there was an intermittent low resistance on the signal circuit. Check for a short to ground on the signal circuit. If it appears OK, then do the above artificial heat test and replace the IAT as necessary. If the problem can't be duplicated, use a voltmeter to watch the signal voltage as you \"wiggle\" test the wiring harness. Watch for a sudden change in voltage indicating a short or open. Replace IAT as necessary.\nThis is a pretty simple code and it only really looks for extremely short changes that are relatively high in voltage. It's usually the sensor that is bad unless the vehicle is extremely old, in which case there may be harness problems. \nOther IAT sensor and circuit related DTCs: P0095, P0096, P0097, P0098, P0099, P0110, P0112, P0113, P0114, P0127\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2012 chevy cruze p0106, p0171, p0111 and p2270i have p0106 , p0171 ,p0111 and p2270 Do i need replace o2 sensors or map sensor and how does this affect my turbo...\u00a0P0111 - Volvo V70 -00In \"Volvo-language\" P0111 - Intake port temperature wrong signal.\n\n(In Swedish, P0111 - Lufttemp inlopp felaktig signal...\u00a0Need help with a P0111 code on my Kia SportageHi can anyone tell me if I need to get this fixed or can I just remove this.

  "P0112": {
    "Meaning": "P0112 Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit Low Input",
    "Common Causes": "To keep these higher temps\n  from causing increased combustion temps, the intake air tubing should be intact,\n  allowing the engine to \"breathe\" air that isn't sampled from the engine\n  compartment.  The IAT measures air temp by using a thermistor, or a thermometer of\n  sorts.  The thermistor is supplied 5 volts reference voltage from the PCM\n  (powertrain control module) and a ground.  Usually, when the air temperature is cold\n  the resistance in the thermistor is high and when the air temperature is warmer, the\n  resistance decreases.  This change in resistance changes the 5 V reference from the\n  PCM, thereby informing the PCM of the temperature of incoming air.  If the PCM\n  notices that the incoming air temp is unusually high, say, 300 degrees, when the\n  engine temp is still relatively low, it will set a P0112.  \n\nSymptoms\nThere may be no noticeable symptoms of a P0112 code other than an MIL (Malfunction\nIndicator Lamp).  However, a emissions test may reveal higher Nox readings depending\non the type of IAT failure.  Or the engine may ping under load, depending on the\ntype of IAT failure.\nCauses\nUsually the P0112 is caused by a bad IAT (internally shorted or open or otherwise damaged), \nbut it could also be:\n\nNo reference voltage to the IAT sensor due to an open wire\nExcessively high intake air temperatures\nShort to ground on signal circuit\nDamaged IAT connector\nBad PCM \n\nPossible Solutions\nHook up your scan tool or code reader and read the IAT reading.  With a cold engine,\nthe IAT should roughly match the coolant reading, since both will read ambient\ntemperature.  If the IAT is reading excessively high, check the IAT connector for\ndamage.  If you find none, unplug the IAT sensor and recheck the reading.  It should\nnow read the minimum, around -20 deg.  If it does, then replace the IAT sensor.  \nBut, if the reading is still high, unplug the sensor and check for resistance across\nthe two wiring harness terminals.  If there is infinite resistance, then the PCM\nitself is bad.  If the resistance isn't infinite, then check and repair the short\nto ground on the signal circuit.\nOther IAT sensor and circuit related DTCs: P0095, P0096, P0097, P0098, P0099, P0110, P0111, P0113, P0114, P0127\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n97 Stratus OBD oddities P0134 P0112 P1496Scanned codes on 97 Dodge Stratus Base, 2.4L Automatic.\nGot codes P0134 (Oxygen Sensor B1 S1)\nP0112  Intake Air Temperature Circuit Low Input  \nP1496  5 volt supply voltage low \n\nTrying to resolve P1496 first, which is could mean any of Shorted sensor, Sensor harness issue, Sensor Circuit poor conne...\u00a01999 Chrysler Concord 3.2L P0340 and P0112While driving my -99 Chrysler Concorde with 105k miles on the 3.2L, the SES light came on, but I noticed no difference in engine performance.

  "P0113": {
    "Meaning": "P0113 IAT Sensor 1 Circuit High Input",
    "Common Causes": "The IAT is a thermistor that varies resistance based on temperature. \n  As the temperature increases, resistance decreases. Low temperature results \n  in a high signal voltage. When the PCM sees a signal voltage higher than 5 volts, \n  it sets this P0113 check engine light code.\nPotential Symptoms\nThere will likely be no symptoms other than illumination of the Malfunction \n  Indicator Lamp (MIL - Check Engine Light / Service Engine Soon).\nCauses\nA code P0113 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:\n\nInternally failed IAT sensor\n Faulty connection at IAT sensor\n Open in IAT ground circuit or signal circuit\n Short to voltage in IAT signal circuit or reference circuit\nIAT harness and/or wiring routed too close to high-voltage wiring (e.g. \n    alternator, spark plug cables, etc.)\n Faulty PCM (less likely but not impossible)\n\nPossible Solutions\nFirst, if you have access to a scan tool, is there an IAT reading? If the IAT \n  reading is logical then the problem is likely intermittent. If the reading is \n  less than -30 degrees, unplug the connector. Install a jumper wire between the \n  harness connector signal and ground circuits. The IAT temperature reading on \n  the scan tool should be maxed out at the high end. For example it should be \n  280 degrees Farenheit or higher. If it is, the wiring is okay, and it may have \n  been the connection. If it isn't install the jumper wire between the IAT signal \n  circuit and the chassis ground.\nIf now the IAT reading on the scan tool is maxed \n  out then check for an open in the IAT ground circuit.

  "P0114": {
    "Meaning": "P0114 IAT Circuit Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM uses the IAT input signal and the mass airflow (MAF) sensor input signal to calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing strategy. Since maintaining a correct air/fuel ratio (typically 14:1) is critical to engine performance and fuel efficiency, the input of the IAT sensor is very important.\nThe IAT sensor can be threaded directly into the intake manifold but is more commonly inserted into the air inlet pipe or air cleaner box. Some manufacturers also integrate the IAT sensor into the MAF sensor housing. At any rate, it must be positioned so that (with the engine running) ambient air, drawn into the intake manifold through the throttle body, can continuously and consistently flow across it. \nThe IAT sensor is usually a two-wire thermistor sensor. Sensor resistance varies according to the temperature of the air that flows across the cold wire element. Most OBD II equipped vehicles utilize a reference voltage (five-volts is normal) and a ground signal to complete the IAT sensor circuit. The varying resistance levels in the IAT sensor element cause voltage fluctuations in the input circuit. These fluctuations are interpreted by the PCM as changes in intake air temperature.\nIf the PCM detects a certain number of intermittent signals from the IAT sensor, over a set period of time, a code P0114 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\n\nSeverity & Symptoms\nThe IAT sensor signal is used by the PCM to calculate fuel delivery strategy, therefore a code P0114 should be treated as severe.\nSymptoms of a P0114 code may include:\n\n Slightly diminished fuel efficiency \n Decreased engine performance (especially upon cold start) \n Hesitation or surge at idle or upon light acceleration \n Other drivability codes may be stored\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Open or shorted IAT sensor wiring and/or connectors \n Defective IAT sensor \n Faulty MAF sensor \n Clogged air filter \n Broken intake air inlet pipe\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nWhen faced with diagnosing a code P0114, I like to have a suitable diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), an infrared thermometer, and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) at my disposal.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve the stored trouble codes and applicable freeze frame data. I normally write this information down in case I need it later. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle. If the code is immediately reset, proceed with the diagnostic process.\nMost professional technicians begin with a visual inspection of IAT sensor related wiring and connectors (don\u2019t forget the air filter and the air inlet pipe). Pay careful attention to the sensor connector as it is susceptible to corrosion because of its close proximity to the battery and coolant reservoir.\nIf the system wiring, connectors, and components appear to be in working order, proceed by connecting the scanner to the diagnostic connector and opening the data stream. By narrowing the data stream to include only pertinent data, you will get a faster response. Use the infrared thermometer to make sure that the IAT reading (on the scanner) correctly reflects actual intake air temperature.\nIf it is incorrect, consult your vehicle information source for IAT sensor testing recommendations. Use the DVOM to test the sensor and compare your findings with vehicle specifications. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply. \nIf the sensor passes the resistance test, check for a sensor reference voltage and a ground. If either one of these are not present repair the open or shorted circuit and retest the system. If system reference and ground signals are present, obtain an IAT sensor voltage to temperature chart from your vehicle information source and use the DVOM to test sensor output voltage. Compare the voltage with the voltage to temperature chart and replace the sensor if actual findings vary from maximum recommended tolerances.\nIf actual IAT input voltage is within specifications, disconnect the electrical connector/s from all related controllers and use the DVOM to test resistance and continuity on all system circuits. Repair or replace circuits that prove to be open or shorted and retest the system.\nIf the IAT sensor and all system circuits are within recommended specifications, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nBy far, the most common cause of a P0114 being stored is a disconnected IAT sensor connector. When the air filter is checked or replaced, the IAT sensor is often left disconnected. If your vehicle has recently been service, and a code P0114 is suddenly stored, suspect that the IAT sensor has simply been left unplugged.\n\nRelated IAT sensor and circuit trouble codes: P0095, P0096, P0097, P0098, P0099, P0110, P0111, P0112, P0113, P0127\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2010 Equinox.

  "P0115": {
    "Meaning": "P0115 Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "As the temperature of the coolant changes, the resistance changes on the ground signal to the PCM. When the engine is cold, the resistance is high.  When the engine is warm, the resistance is low.  If the PCM detects a voltage condition that seems abnormally low or high, P0115 will set. \n\n  An example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensor\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0115 DTC code may include:\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination will always occur\nVehicle may be hard to start \nMay blow a lot of black smoke and run extremely rich\nEngine may want to die or backfire in tailpipe\nEngine may run lean and increased Nox emissions may be apparent (Requires gas analyzer)\nCooling fans may run all the time when they shouldn't be, or not at all when they should be\n\nCauses\nUsually the cause can be traced to a bad ECT sensor, however that doesn't preclude the following:\n\n Wiring or connector damaged at sensor\n Open  or short in reference or signal circuit\nOpen or short in signal circuit\nBad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nFirst, visually check the sensor for damage to wiring or connector and repair as necessary.  Then, if you have access to a scanner, determine what the temperature of the engine is.  (If you don't have access to a scan tool, using the dash temperature gauge may not be an effective way to determine coolant temperature.  This is because the P0115 code is referring to the ECT SENSOR, and the dash gauge is operated by, usually a one-wire SENDER. Basically a different sensor that the code doesn't refer to.)\n2.  If the engine temperature is abnormally high, around 280 deg. F, that's abnormal.  Unplug the sensor on the engine and see if the signal drops to, say, negative 50 deg. F. If it does, then it's a good bet the sensor is bad, internally shorted, causing a low resistance signal to be sent to the PCM.  However if you want to be sure it's the sensor and not the wiring, there's a couple tests you can do.  With the ECT sensor unplugged, check that you have 5 volts on the reference circuit with KOEO (Key on engine off).      Also you can check the resistance of the sensor to ground using an Ohm meter.  The resistance of a normal sensor to ground will vary a little depending on the vehicle, but basically, if the temp of the engine is around 200 deg. F., the resistance will be about 200 Ohms.  If the temperature is about 0 def. F., the resistance will be over 10,000 Ohms.  With this test you should be able to tell if the resistance of the sensor matches the temperature of the engine.  If it's not accurate according to your engine's temperature, then you probably have a bad sensor.\n3. Now, if the temperature of the engine according to the scanner is around 280 deg. F. and unplugging the sensor doesn't cause the reading to drop to negative 50 deg. F, but it stays at the same high temperature reading, then you'll need to repair the short on the signal circuit(ground) to the PCM. It's shorted directly to ground somewhere.\n4. If your temperature reading of the engine according to the scanner is showing negative 50 deg. F or so, (and you don't live in the arctic!) unplug the sensor and check for a 5V reference present at the sensor.\n5. If there isn't, then check at the PCM connector for proper 5V reference.  If it's present at the PCM connector, then repair the open or short on 5V reference from PCM. If there is no 5V reference present at the PCM connector, then you're done with your diagnosis and you may have a PCM fault.   6. If the 5V reference circuit is intact, then check the ground signal to the PCM using the previous ground resistance test.  If the resistance isn't normal for the temperature of the engine, then ohm the resistance of the ground signal to the PCM by removing the ground signal wire from the PCM connector.  The wire should have no resistance, unplugged from the PCM to the sensor.  If it does, repair open in the signal to the PCM.  If it doesn't have any resistance on the ground signal wire and the resistance test of the sensor is normal, then suspect a faulty PCM. \nOther coolant engine light codes: P0115, P0116, P0117, P0118, P0119, P0125, P0128\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nODB P011595 Subaru Impreza, auto transmission, 2.2 L engine.

    "Meaning": "P0116 ECT Sensor Circuit Range/Performance",
    "Common Causes": "As the temperature of the coolant changes the resistance on the signal wire changes accordingly. The PCM monitors the reading and determines coolant temperature in order to perform essential engine fuel management. When engine coolant is low, sensor resistance is high. The PCM will see a high signal voltage (low temperature). When coolant is warm, the sensor's resistance is low and the PCM will see a high temperature. The PCM expects to see slow resistance changes on the ECT signal circuit. If it sees a quick change in voltage that isn't consistent with an engine warming up, this P0116 code will set.

  "P0117": {
    "Meaning": "P0117 ECT Sensor Circuit Low Input",
    "Common Causes": "As the temperature of the coolant changes, the resistance of the sensor changes. When the engine is cold, the resistance is high. When the engine is warm, the resistance is low. If the PCM detects a signal voltage lower than the normal operating range of the sensor then P0117 code will set.\n\n  An example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensor\nSymptoms\nPotential symptoms include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nPoor fuel economy\nPoor drivability\nEngine may run rough or blow black smoke out the tailpipe\nMay not idle\nMay start and then die\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of the P0117 code include: \n\nBad ECT sensor\nShort to ground on ECT signal circuit\nFaulty or damaged connectors\nWiring harness damaged\nLoose terminals at ECT or PCM\nPOSSIBLY an overheated engine\nBad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nSince this code is for an abnormally low signal to the PCM from the ECT, the PCM saw a excessively \"hot\" condition in the engine coolant. This could be due to faulty ECT sensor or wiring, but it could, conceivably, be caused by an overheated engine.So if your engine was overheated diagnose that first. Having said that here are the possible solutions:\nUsing a scan tool, with KOEO (Key on engine off) check the ECT reading on the display. On a cold engine the ECT reading should match the IAT (Intake Air Temperature) sensor reading. If it doesn't, replace the ECT sensor.\n1. If the ECT reading is showing an excessively hot reading, for example more than 260 deg. F, then unplug the ECT sensor. This should cause the ECT reading to drop to the extreme cold reading (around -30 deg.F or so). If it does, replace the sensor, because it's internally shorted. If it doesn't change the reading, the check for a short to ground on the signal circuit of the ECT wiring. It could be that the two ECT wires are shorted to each other. Look for any chafing or melted wiring. Repair as necessary.\na. If you can't find any wiring problems and the ECT reading doesn't drop to the extreme coldest when unplugged, then, check for voltage coming out of the PCM on the signal wire's pin at the PCM connector. If there isn't any voltage, or it is low, then the PCM may be bad. NOTE: On some models it is possible for the 5 Volt reference signal to be temperarily shorted. This can happen if an engine sensor internally shorts the 5 Volt reference. Since the 5 Volt reference is a \"shared\" circuit on many models, this will cause it to be abnormally low. Usually, though this will be accompanied by several other sensor codes. If you suspect that may be the case, unplug each sensor until the 5 Volt reference reappears. The last sensor unplugged is the offending sensor. Replace and recheck the signal wire from the PCM connector\n2. If the scan tool ECT reading seems normal at this time then the problem may be intermittent. Use a \"wiggle\" test to manipulate the wiring harness and connectors while watching the ECT reading on the scan tool. Repair any wiring or connectors that are loose or corroded. You could check the Freeze frame data if your scan tool has that function. It will show the ECT reading when the failure occurred. If it shows the reading to be at the hottest extreme then replace the ECT sensor and see if the code reappears. \nOther ECT sensor and circuit related DTCs: P0115, P0116, P0118, P0119, P0125, P0128\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n99 Grand Am P0117 trouble codeI have a 99 Pontiac Grand Am 3.4.

  "P0119": {
    "Meaning": "P0119 Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor Circuit Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM monitors ECT using a reference circuit (typically five-volts) that is completed by the ECT sensor. If separate ECT sensors are used (one for the PCM and another for the temperature gauge), the sensor itself is usually of a two-wire design. The first wire carries the five-volt reference and the second wire is the ground wire. The ECT sensor is usually a negative coefficient sensor, which means that as sensor temperature is increased, resistance decreases. The variation in sensor resistance translates into fluctuations in circuit voltage that are recognized by the PCM as changes in ECT. If the PCM and the temperature gauge use the same ECT sensor, then the sensor will be of a three-wire design. It reacts to temperature the same way as the two-wire sensor but one wire feeds an input signal to the gauge and one wire feeds an input signal to the PCM. Simple, huh?\nAlthough ECT location will differ between manufacturers, it will always be threaded directly into an engine coolant passage. Many automakers place the ECT sensor in the cylinder block or cylinder head, others thread it into one of the intake manifold coolant passages, and some locate it in the thermostat housing. \nWith the ECT sensor threaded into the engine, the tip of the sensor, which contains the thermistor, protrudes into the coolant passage. With the engine running, coolant should constantly flow across the tip. As engine coolant increases in temperature, so does the thermistor inside of the ECT sensor. \nThe PCM uses engine temperature to help calculate fuel delivery, idle speed, and ignition timing. The ECT sensor input is critical because the engine control system must function differently as engine temperature changes from ambient temperature to more than 220-degrees Fahrenheit. The PCM also uses the ECT sensor input to initiate electric cooling fan operation.\nIf the PCM receives input signals from the ECT sensor that are erratic or intermittent, during a set period of time and under certain circumstances, a code P0119 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. \n\n  An example of an Engine Coolant Temperature ECT sensor\nSeverity & Symptoms\nBecause the ECT sensor plays such an important role in engine drivability, the code P0119 should be addressed urgently.\nSymptoms of a P0119 code may include:\n\n Rough engine idle on cold start \n Hesitation or stumble on acceleration \n Rich exhaust smell, especially on cold start \n Possible engine overheating \n Electric cooling fan running constantly or not running at all\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Low engine coolant level \n Faulty thermostat \n Bad ECT sensor\n Open or shorted wiring and/or connectors in ECT sensor circuit\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nWhen faced with diagnosing a code P0119, I like to have a suitable diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), an infrared thermometer, and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) on hand.\nI like to connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector, retrieve stored trouble codes and freeze frame data, and write this information down, to begin my diagnosis. Now, clear the codes.\nNext, I would perform a visual inspection of ECT sensor wiring and connectors. Repair or replace burnt or damaged wiring and/or connectors as required and retest the system. If the P0119 is not immediately reset, it may be intermittent. Operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters OBD-II readiness mode or the code is reset. If the P0119 is now reset, continue with your diagnosis.\nReconnect the scanner and bring up the appropriate data stream. Narrow the data stream so that only pertinent data is shown and data response will be much faster. Observe the ECT sensor temperature and voltage while looking for glitches or inconsistencies. These will be seen by the PCM as intermittent ECT sensor circuit signals. If there are inconsistencies, inspect the ECT sensor connector for signs of corrosion. Check wiring that is routed near hot exhaust manifolds/headers (intermittent short to ground) and loose or broken connector pins at the ECT sensor. Repair or replace defective components as required.\nLow engine coolant may also contribute to a code P0119 being stored. With the engine cool, remove the high pressure cap and make sure that the engine is full of the recommended coolant. If the engine coolant level is down by more than several quarts, inspect the engine for a coolant leak. A cooling system pressure tester may be helpful for this. Repair leaks as necessary, refill the system with suitable coolant, and retest the system.\n If the ECT sensor is observed (in the scanner data stream display) as being extremely low or high, suspect that it is defective. Using the DVOM, test ECT sensor resistance and compare your findings with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply.\nIf the ECT sensor seems slightly low or high, use the infrared thermometer to obtain actual ECT. Compare the ECT sensor signal reflected in the data stream with actual ECT and discard the sensor if the two do not coincide.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Make sure that the engine is full of coolant, and the thermostat is operating properly, before attempting to diagnose a P0119 \n Other ECT sensor codes, as well as engine over temp codes, may accompany this type of code \n Diagnose and repair other ECT related codes prior to diagnosing the P0119\n\nOther ECT sensor diagnostic codes include P0115, P0116, P0117, and P0118.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nP0119 code 2004 f150 5.4Had  engine coolant temp sensor replaced twice still throwing code p0119.

  "P0120": {
    "Meaning": "P0120 TPS A Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "The TPS sends the throttle position information back to the PCM on this signal wire. When the throttle is closed the signal is near .45 volts. At WOT (Wide Open Throttle) the TPS signal voltage will approach a full 5 volts. When the PCM sees a voltage that is outside of normal operating range, P0120 will set.\nNOTE: The PCM knows that any large change in throttle position means a cooresponding change in manifold pressure (MAP). On some models the PCM will monitor MAP and TPS operation for comparison. Meaning that if the PCM sees a large percentage change in throttle position, it expects to see a cooresponding change in manifold pressure and vice versa. If it doesn't see this comparitive change, P0120 may set. This doesn't apply to all models.\nSymptoms\nPotential symptoms include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nMisfiring at idle or at highway speed\nPoor idle quality\nPossibly won't idle\nPossibly starts and stalls \n\nCauses\nPotential causes of the P0120 code include: \n\nSticking throttle return spring\nMAP or TPS connector corrosion\nMisrouted harness causing chafing\nBad TPS\nBad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf you have access to a scan tool, with KOEO (Key on engine off) observe the TPS voltage. With throttle closed, voltage should be about .45 volts. It should gradually sweep upwards to approximately 4.5 to 5 volts as you depress the throttle. Sometimes only a scope can capture an intermittent glitch in the TPS signal voltage. If you notice a glitch in the TPS sweep voltage, replace the TPS.\nNOTE: Some TPS sensors require fine adjustment. If you aren't comfortable with using a DVOM (Digital Volt Ohm meter) to adjust the new TPS, then it's best to take the vehicle to a shop. If the voltage is not .45 volts (+or- .3 volts or so) with the throttle closed or if the reading is \"stuck\" then unplug the TPS connector. With KOEO check for 5 volts reference voltage present at the connector and a good ground. You can check the signal circuit for continuity by jumping a fused wire between the ground circuit of the TPS connector and the signal circuit. If the TPS reading on the scan tool now reads zero, then replace the TPS. However if that doesn't change the reading to zero, then check for an open or a short on the signal wire and if none is found, suspect a bad PCM. If manipulating the TPS wiring harness causes any change in idle, then suspect bad TPS. \nOther TPS sensor and circuit related DTCs: P0121, P0122, P0123, P0124\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2003 Chevy Tahoe P0120 P2135 Reduced Engine Poweri have a 2003 chevy Tahoe with a 5.3 vortec.

  "P0121": {
    "Meaning": "P0121 Throttle Position Sensor/Switch A Circuit Range/Performance Problem",
    "Common Causes": "The powertrain control module (PCM) supplies a 5 Volt reference signal \n  to the throttle position sensor (TPS) and usually a ground also. A general measurement \n  is: at idle = .5 Volts; full throttle = 4.5 Volts. If the PCM detects that the \n  throttle angle is greater or less than it should be for a specific RPM, it will \n  set this code.\nPotential Symptoms\nSymptoms of a P0121 trouble code could include:\n\nMalfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination (Check Engine Light or Service \n    Engine Soon light)\n Intermittent stumble on acceleration or deceleration\n Blows black smoke on acceleration\nNo start\n\nCauses\nA code P0121 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:\n\nTPS has intermittent open or short internally\nHarness is rubbing and causing an open or short in the wiring\n Bad connection at the TPS\n Bad PCM (less likely)\n Water or corrosion in connector or sensor\n\nPossible Solutions\n1. If you have access to a scan tool, see what the idle and WOT (wide open \n  throttle) readings are for the TPS. Check if they're close to the specifications \n  mentioned above. If not, then replace the TPS and re-check.\n2. Check for an intermittent open or short in the TPS signal. To do that, you \n  can't use a scan tool. You'll need an oscilliscope. The reason is because scan \n  tools take samplings of many different readings over just one or two data lines \n  and can miss an intermittent drop out. Hook up your oscilliscope and watch the \n  signal. It should sweep up and down smoothly with no drop outs or spikes.\n3. If no problems were noticed, perform a wiggle test. Do this by wiggling \n  the connector and harness while watching the pattern. Does it drop out? If so, \n  replace TPS and re-check.\n4. If you have no TPS signal, check for 5 Volt reference at the connector. \n  If it's present, check the ground circuit for open or shorts.\n5. Make sure the signal circuit isn't 12V. It should never have battery voltage. \n  If it does, trace circuit for short to voltage and repair.\n6.

  "P0124": {
    "Meaning": "P0124 Throttle Position Sensor/Switch A Circuit Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "The TPS is typically a potentiometer type sensor that completes a five-volt reference circuit. The TPS is mechanically actuated using an extension of the throttle plate shaft or a specially designed tab on the sensor. As the throttle is opened and closed, contacts in the sensor are dragged across a circuit board, varying sensor resistance. As sensor resistance is changed, TPS circuit voltage fluctuates. The PCM recognizes these fluctuations as varying degrees of throttle plate actuation.\nThe PCM uses input voltage signals from the TPS to calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing. It also uses TPS input data to monitor intake air flow, exhaust oxygen content, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) function, and engine load percentage.\nIf the PCM detects a certain number of intermittent or erratic signals from the TPS, over a set period of time, and under a programmed set of circumstances, a code P0124 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nThe TPS plays an important role in engine drivability, therefore a stored code P0124 should be addressed with some degree of urgency.\nSymptoms of a P0124 code may include:\n\n Hesitation upon acceleration \n Black smoke from engine exhaust (especially on start up) \n Delayed engine startup (particularly on cold start) \n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Stored emissions related codes may accompany a P0124\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Defective or misadjusted TPS \n Open or shorted TPS \"A\" wiring or connectors \n Binding or damaged throttle plate \n Bad PCM or a PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nI typically use a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and an accurate vehicle information source (ALL DATA DIY) to diagnose a code P0124. \nA successful diagnosis usually begins with a visual inspection of all system related wiring and connectors. I also like to test the throttle plate for signs of carbon coking or damage. Repair or replace defective wiring or components as required, then recheck the throttle body and TPS.\nConnect the scanner to the diagnostic connector; retrieve all stored trouble codes and write them down for future reference. I also keep any related freeze frame data. My notes are often helpful if the stored code proves to be intermittent. Next, I would clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle. Continue with the diagnosis if the code is reset. If it is not reset, the condition may need to worsen before a correct diagnosis can be made. Operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters readiness mode or the code is reset.\nProceed by checking for technical service bulletins (TSB) that apply to the particular malfunction (and vehicle) in question by consulting your vehicle information source. If applicable, use the information contained in the appropriate TSB to help with your diagnosis. TSBs can be especially helpful when diagnosing an intermittent condition.\nThe scanner data stream may yield useful information regarding glitches and inconsistencies in the throttle position sensor. If you narrow the scanner data stream to display only pertinent data, you will get a more accurate data response. \nIf no glitches are detected, use the DVOM to test the TPS. Using the DVOM gives you access to live data if the appropriate test leads are connected to the ground and signal circuits. Watch the DVOM display while operating the throttle manually. Look for glitches in voltage as the throttle is actuated slowly from the closed position to wide open throttle. Voltage typically ranges from .5-volts at closed throttle to 4.5-volts at wide open throttle. If glitches or other inconsistencies are detected, suspect that the sensor being tested is defective or misadjusted.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n If the TPS has been replaced and a P0124 continues to be stored, consult the vehicle information source for TPS adjustment specs \n Use the DVOM (with the test leads connected to the ground and signal circuits) to adjust the TPS accurately\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n96 dodge ram Error codes P0124 and P0343Hi\n :(  We have 96 dodge ram 1500 V6 standard and have error codes\n124 and 343.

In the case of Mazda, there are some known TSBs and the fix is to reprogram the PCM because this code is triggered due to a \"glitch\" in the PCM's programming.\nThat's not to say that if you have a Mazda this is the only possible fix. It is still possible there is a physical problem with the wiring, thermostat, etc. Again, refer to TSBs first before replacing parts to see if they apply to you.\n\nCheck to ensure proper cooling fan operation. On when it should be on, off when it should be off, repair as necessary. If the cooling fan is always on, it could be causing the engine to warm up too slowly or not warm up to proper operating temperature.\nCheck engine coolant level. If low, top up, clear code and drive vehicle to see if it returns.\nRefer to the \"freeze frame\" data and view live data using a code scanner to see the value of the engine temperature sensor. Compare with manufacturers specifications.\nUse a laser thermometer to verify the temperature of the coolant as close as safe, measure the temperature of the engine and compare with the value of the sensor reading.\nInspect for a faulty thermostat, coolant temperature sensor (CTS), and wiring.

  "P0127": {
    "Meaning": "P0127 Intake Air Temperature Too High",
    "Common Causes": "The IAT sensor input and the mass airflow (MAF) sensor input signals are used by the PCM to calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing. Sustaining an air/fuel ratio of 14.7:1 is vital to engine performance and fuel efficiency; therefore the input of the IAT sensor is critical.\nThe IAT sensor is typically inserted into the air inlet pipe or air cleaner box but it may also be threaded directly into the intake manifold. The IAT sensor may also be integrated into the MAF sensor housing. Regardless of design, it must be positioned so that (with the engine running) ambient air, drawn into the intake manifold through the throttle body, can continuously and consistently flow across it. \nThe IAT sensor is normally a two-wire thermistor sensor. As varying degrees of air flow across the cold wire element, sensor resistance varies according to temperature. In other words, the more air that flows across the cold-wire element, the lower the degree of temperature and resistance it provides. OBD II equipped vehicles generally use a reference voltage (five-volts is normal) and a ground signal with the IAT sensor completing the circuit. The varying degrees of resistance in the IAT sensor element create voltage fluctuations in the input circuit. These fluctuations are recognized by the PCM as variations in intake air temperature.\nIf the PCM detects a level of voltage from the IAT sensor that is higher than the maximum allowable limit, a code P0127 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nThe IAT sensor signal is used by the PCM to calculate fuel delivery strategy, therefore a code P0127 should be considered severe. Symptoms of a P0127 code may include:\n\n Hesitation or surge at idle or upon light acceleration\n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Decreased engine performance (especially on cold start) \nOther drivability codes may also be stored\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this code include:\n\n IAT sensor harness has been left unplugged \n Open or shorted IAT sensor wiring and/or connectors \n Defective IAT sensor \n Faulty MAF sensor \n Clogged air filter \n Broken intake air inlet pipe\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nWhen diagnosing a code P0127, you will need a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), an infrared thermometer, and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY).\nI would begin by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieving the stored trouble codes and applicable freeze frame data. I like to write this information down in case I need it later. Next, I\u2019d clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle. Should the code be reset, go to the next step.\nI would proceed with a visual inspection of IAT sensor related wiring and connectors (don\u2019t forget the air filter and the air inlet pipe). Pay careful attention to the sensor connector as it is susceptible to corrosion because of its close proximity to the battery and coolant reservoir. Check technical service bulletins (TSB) that apply to the vehicle and the malfunction in question.\nI would continue by connecting the scanner to the diagnostic connector and opening the data stream if the system wiring, connectors, and components appear to be in good working order. You can get faster response by narrowing the data stream to include only pertinent data. Using the infrared thermometer, make sure that the IAT reading (on the scanner) correctly reflects actual intake air temperature.\nIf the temperatures coincide, consult your vehicle information source for IAT sensor testing recommendations. Use the DVOM to test the sensor. Compare your findings with manufacturer\u2019s specifications. You must replace the sensor if it fails to comply. \nCheck for sensor reference voltage and a ground at the sensor connector, if the sensor passes the resistance test. If reference voltage and grounds are not present, repair the open or shorted circuit and retest the system. If system reference and ground signals are present, find the IAT sensor voltage to temperature chart in your vehicle information source and use the DVOM to test sensor output voltage. Compare actual voltage with the temperature to voltage chart. Replace the sensor if the actual reading varies from the temp to voltage chart.\nIf IAT reference voltage is within specifications, disconnect the electrical connector/s from all related controllers and use the DVOM to test resistance and continuity in all system circuits. Circuits that prove to be open or shorted should be repaired or replaced.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nWhen the air filter is checked or replaced, the IAT sensor is often left disconnected. If your vehicle has recently been service, and a code P0127 is suddenly stored, suspect that the IAT sensor has simply been left unplugged. Reconnect it, clear the code, and drive the vehicle as normal (until the PCM enters readiness mode) to rectify the situation.\n\nRelated IAT sensor and circuit trouble codes: P0095, P0096, P0097, P0098, P0099, P0110, P0111, P0112, P0113, P0114\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0129": {
    "Meaning": "P0129 Barometric Pressure Too Low",
    "Common Causes": "The barometric pressure sensor lets the PCM monitor changes in atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure is related exactly to the particular degree of altitude, as it applies to your vehicle. This information is used by the PCM to help calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing strategy.\nThe barometric pressure sensor is usually supplied with a reference voltage signal, a battery ground, and one (or more) output signal circuit/s. The BPS completes the reference voltage circuit and provides the appropriate resistance as determined by actual barometric pressure. \nAs changes in atmospheric pressure occur, BPS resistance levels react accordingly. Fluctuating resistance in the BPS causes changes in sensor output voltage to the PCM. These changing voltage signals are not only used by the PCM to map fuel delivery and ignition timing strategy but also compared to programmed parameters for code storing. \nBecause automakers uses varying designs for monitoring barometric pressure, you will need to consult your vehicle information source (All Data DIY is a good one) to determine the exact BPS design of your vehicle. Most manufacturers use a BPS that is separate from the MAP sensor. It is mounted away from the engine and typically has a vacuum hose connected to it. \nSome models use a system in which the BPS integrated with the MAP sensor. In this type of system, manifold absolute pressure is usually substituted for barometric pressure and the scanner data stream will reflect this terminology.\nIf the PCM detects a BPS input signal that varies from comparison data by more than the programmed limit, a P0129 will be stored and a MIL will possibly be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nSymptoms of a P0129 code may include:\n\n Excessively rich fuel delivery conditions \n General lack of engine performance \n Hesitation upon acceleration \n Black smoke from exhaust \n Diminished fuel efficiency\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this code include:\n\n Corroded connector face at the MAF/BPS sensor \nInsufficient engine vacuum due to engine wear, an ignition misfire or clogged catalytic converter\n Faulty BPS \n Open or shorted wiring for the MAP sensor and/or the BPS \n Insufficient system ground at the MAF/BPS \n Defective PCM or PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nWhen I am diagnosing a P0129, I know that I will need a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), a vacuum gauge, and a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY).\nI normally like to begin my diagnosis with a visual inspection of all system related wiring harnesses and connectors. Any damaged wiring or corroded connector faces should be repaired before proceeding with the diagnosis.\nI would continue by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieving all stored codes. Next, I like to make a note of all codes and freeze frame data as this information may prove useful in the event that I am dealing with an intermittent code. Next, I clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle to see if the code is reset.\nIf it is, I would perform a manual engine vacuum test to ensure that the engine is making sufficient vacuum. I would consult my vehicle information source for specifications that apply to my vehicle. If the engine is not performing efficiently, it will not produce enough vacuum for the BPS or MAP sensor. Engine misfire codes, fuel system codes, and catalytic converter codes should be diagnosed and repaired before attempting to diagnose this code. \nBe aware that barometric pressure sensors which are integrated with the MAF sensor are subject to corrosion at the connector face. These types of systems are also prone to faults caused by an extremely dirty air filter element. I have also discovered that this type of BPS configurations will often require that an auxiliary ground be installed (depending upon manufacturer). \nContinue testing at the BPS if all circuits and connectors appear to be operational. Unplug the electrical connector and check resistance across all circuits of the BPS using the DVOM. If the sensor fails to comply with specifications, replace it.\nIf the BPS meets manufacturer\u2019s specifications, begin testing system circuits. To prevent damage, disconnect all related controllers before testing system circuits with the DVOM. Repair or replace open or shorted circuits as needed.\nSuspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error if the sensor and all circuits are compliant with manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Consider all other possibilities before replacement and remember that replacement of system controllers will require reprogramming.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nFor further diagnostic help, consult your vehicle information source for technical service bulletins that apply to the barometric pressure sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, or mass air flow sensor of your vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2006 Dodge Caravan code P01292006  Dodge Caravan 3.6 V6 I don\u2019t understand after all these years that this code would come up.

  "P0130": {
    "Meaning": "P0130 O2 Sensor Circuit Malfunction (Bank 1, Sensor 1)",
    "Common Causes": "The ECM constantly monitors this voltage while in closed loop to determine \n  how much fuel to inject. If the ECM determines that the O2 sensor voltage was \n  too low (less than .4 Volts) for too long (for more than 20 seconds (time varies \n  with model)), this code is set.\nPotential Symptoms\nDepending if the problem is intermittent or not, there may be no symptoms other \n  than MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination. If the problem is constant, \n  then symptoms may include one or more of the following:\n\nMIL illumination\nEngine runs rough, missing or stumbling\nBlows black smoke from tail pipe\nEngine dies\n Poor fuel economy\n\nCauses\nUsually the cause of P0130 is a bad oxygen sensor, however this isn't always \n  the case. If your o2 sensors haven't been replaced and they are old, it's a \n  good bet that the sensor is the problem. But, It could be caused by any of the \n  following:\n\n Water or corrosion in the connector\nLoose terminals in the connector\nWiring burnt on exhaust components\n Open or short in the wiring due to rubbing on engine components\n Holes in exhaust allowing unmetered oxygen into exhaust system\n Unmetered vacuum leak at the engine\n Bad o2 sensor\n Bad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nUsing a scan tool, determine if the Bank \n  1, sensor 1 is switching properly. It should switch rapidly between rich \n  and lean, evenly.\n1. If it does, the problem is likely intermittent and you should examine the \n  wiring for any visible damage. Then perform a wiggle test by manipulating the \n  connector and wiring while watching the o2 sensor voltage. If it drops out, \n  fix the appropriate part of the wiring harness where problem resides.\n2. If it doesn't switch properly, try to determine if the sensor is accurately \n  reading the exhaust or not. Do this by removing the fuel pressure regulator \n  vacuum supply briefly. The o2 sensor reading should go rich, reacting to the \n  extra fuel added. Reinstall regulator supply. Then induce a lean condition by \n  removing a vacuum supply line from the intake manifold. The o2 sensor reading \n  should go lean, reacting to the enleaned exhaust. If the sensor operates properly, \n  then the sensor may be okay and the problem may be holes in the exhaust or an \n  unmetered vacuum leak in the engine (NOTE: Unmetered vacuum leaks at the engine \n  are almost always accompanied by lean codes. Refer to the appropriate articles \n  for diagnosing an unmetered vacuum leak). If the exhaust does have holes in \n  it, it's possible that the o2 sensor may be misreading the exhaust because of \n  the extra oxygen entering the pipe via those holes\n3. If none of this is the case and the o2 sensor just isn't switching or acts \n  sluggish, unplug the sensor and make sure there is 5 Volt reference voltage \n  to the sensor. Then check for 12V supply to the o2 sensor's heater circuit. \n  Also check for continuity to ground on the ground circuit. If any of these are \n  missing, or aren't their proper voltage, repair open or short in the appropriate \n  wire. The o2 sensor will not operate properly without proper voltage. If the \n  proper voltages are present, replace the o2 sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n1996 Subaru OBII codes P0130, P0400 and P0740I own a 1996 Subaru Legacy Outback with a 2.5L, auto with 164k miles.

  "P0140": {
    "Meaning": "P0140 O2 Sensor Circuit No Activity Detected (B1S2)",
    "Common Causes": "O2 sensors on a specific bank marked as \n  \"sensor 2\" (as this one is) are used to monitor emissions. A Three-Way \n  Catalyst (TWC) system (catalytic converter) is used to control tailpipe emissions. \n  The PCM uses the signal received from Oxygen sensor 2 (#2 indicates aft of catalytic \n  converter, #1 indicates pre-converter) to read efficiency of TWC. Normally this \n  sensor will switch between high and low voltage at a noticeably slower rate \n  than the front sensor. This is normal. If the signal received from rear (#2) \n  O2 sensor indicates that the voltage has \"stuck\" between .425V to \n  .474 V, the PCM determines this sensor is inactive and this code will set.\nPotential Symptoms\nYour check engine light(CEL), or malfuction indicator lamp (MIL) will be illuminated. \n  There will not likely be any noticeable drivability problems other than the \n  MIL. The reason is this: The rear or post catalytic converter Oxygen sensor \n  does not affect fuel deliver(this is an exception on Chryslers). It only MONITORS \n  the efficiency of the catalytic converter. For this reason, you will likely \n  not notice any engine trouble.\nCauses\nThe causes for a P0140 code are fairly few. They could be any of the following:\n\nShorted heater circuit in O2 sensor. (Usually requires replacement of heater \n    circuit fuse in fuse block also)\n Shorted signal circuit in O2 sensor\n Melting of harness connector or wiring due to contact with exhaust system\n Water intrusion in harness connector or PCM connector\n Bad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nThis is a fairly specific problem and shouldn't be too difficult to diagnose.\nFirst, start engine and warm up. Using a scan tool, watch the Bank 1, sensor \n  2, o2 sensor voltage. Normally the voltage should switch slowly above and below \n  .45 volts. If it does, the problem is likely intermittent. You'll have to wait \n  for the problem to surface before you can accurately diagnose.\nHowever, if it doesn't switch, or is stuck then perform the following: 2. Shut \n  off vehicle. Visually check the Bank1,2 harness connector for melting or chafing \n  of the harness or the connector. Repair or replace as needed 3. Turn ignition \n  on, but engine off. Disconnect the O2 sensor connector and check for 12Volts \n  at the Heater Circuit supply and for proper ground on the heater circuit ground \n  circuit. a. If 12V heater supply is missing, check the proper fuses for an open \n  in the circuit. If heater circuit fuse is blown, then suspect a bad heater in \n  the o2 sensor causing a blown heater circuit fuse. Replace sensor and fuse and \n  recheck. b. If ground is missing, trace the circuit and clean or repair ground \n  circuit. 4. Next, with connector still unplugged, check for 5 Volts on the reference \n  circuit. If this is missing, check for 5 Volts at the PCM connector. If 5 Volts \n  is present at the PCM connector but not at the o2 sensor harness connector, \n  then there is an open or short in the reference wire supply between the PCM \n  and the o2 sensor connector. However, if there is no 5 Volts present at the \n  PCM connector, the PCM is likely at fault due to internal short. Replace PCM. \n  ** (NOTE: on Chrysler models, a common problem is the 5Volt reference circuit \n  can be shorted out by any sensor on the car that uses a 5 Volt reference. Simply \n  unplug each sensor one at a time until the 5 Volts reappears. The last sensor \n  you unplugged is the shorted sensor. Replacing it should fix the 5 Volt reference \n  short.) 5. If all the voltages and grounds are present, then replace the Bank \n  1,2 O2 sensor and re-test.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nP0140 Even After O2 ReplacementKept getting this code so I replaced the O2 sensor behind the catalytic converter, the code keeps reappearing, pending almost instantly, confirmed in 15 minutes or so, scan tool reports \"the code error \"Oxygen Sensor Circuit No Activity Detected Bank 1 Sensor 2\" this sensor is however reading and no...\u00a0'07 suzuki forenza with codes: P1138, P0140, P0037---------------\n\nP1138=manufacturer controlled fuel and air metering\n\nP0140=O2 sensor circuit no activity detected bank 1 sensor 2\n\nP0037=heated O2 sensor heater control circuit low bank 1 sensor 2\n\nI am assuming this is a vacuum leak, but not sure where to start.

  "P0142": {
    "Meaning": "P0142 02 Sensor Circuit Malfunction B1S3",
    "Common Causes": "A P0142 code refers to the Bank 1,3 O2 sensor or the 3rd downstream (post-cat) O2 sensor on Bank 1. It is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a ground circuit and a reference voltage circuit of about 0.5 volts. Also for the O2 sensor heater element there is a battery voltage supply wire and another ground circuit for that. The O2 sensor heater allows the O2 sensor to warm up faster, thus achieving closed loop in less time than it would normally take for the exhaust to warm the sensor up to operating temperature. The O2 sensor varies the supplied reference voltage based on oxygen content in the exhaust. It is capable of varying from about 0.1 to 0.9 volts, 0.1v indicating lean exhaust and 0.9v indicating rich exhaust. This P0142 code indicates that the Bank 1,3 O2 sensor is stuck low for too long or isn't active at all. \nSymptoms\nOften post-cat O2 sensor problems present few symptoms since they are inputs to the PCM to monitor catalytic converter quality and don't directly control fuel. sometimes no symptoms are noticeable. However the following may be possible on some vehicles:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nDecrease in MPG\nIncrease in tailpipe emissions \n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0142 code include:\n\nBad O2 sensor\nSignal shorted to voltage\nWiring problems due to contact with exhaust components\nHoles in exhaust near O2 sensor \n\nPossible Solutions\nIf you have access to a scan tool, check the signal voltage for the Bank 1,3 oxygen sensor with the engine at normal operating temperature. Is it stuck low currently? If so, increase RPM for a few seconds and see if it affects the reading. If it begins working with increased RPM, check for holes in the exhaust near the O2 sensor that may cause a false lean. If the exhaust pipe is intact, the sensor is sluggish, replace it. If the Bank 1,3 O2 sensor voltage reading remains low with increased RPM, unplug it and then observe the reading. It should have increased to about 0.5 volts or thereabouts. If it did, check for water intrusion or other connector problems. If none are found, replace the shorted O2 sensor.\nIf the voltage reading is still stuck low after unplugging the sensor, then suspect a wiring problem. Using a voltmeter, with the O2 sensor unplugged, check for voltage on the signal circuit at the O2 sensor connector (PCM side). It can vary with model, but should be about 0.5 volts and not above 1 volt. If the voltage reading is too high, repair short to voltage on signal circuit. If the signal voltage checks out, suspect the PCM.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

    "Common Causes": "This is the bank 1,3 sensor. It's a four wire sensor being supplied a 0.5 volt reference voltage as well as a power and ground circuit for the o2 sensor heater element. There is also a signal wire from the oxygen sensor to the PCM that can vary between about 0.1 volts to about 0.9 volts according to oxygen content of the exhaust. A properly working post-cat sensor will exhibit small changes at a slower rate than front o2 sensors.\nTo over simplify: a post-cat sensor's main job is to monitor catalyst efficiency, not control fuel management (although they can have a measure of influence over the front o2 sensor's operation). If the PCM determines that the post-cat o2 sensor signal voltage is below a certain threshold for too long, P0143 will set. PCM detected the HO2S signal was less than 156 mv for 28 seconds. \nSymptoms\nUsually rear o2 sensor problems won't cause drivability issues since they are an input that measures catalyst efficiency (unlike front o2 sensors). However if you have other codes present, like lean codes or pre-o2 sensor codes, then they may cause drivability problems as well as P0143. The following symptoms may be present:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nEngine performance issues\nEngine running rough\nEngine running rich\nPoor idle\n\nCauses\nAn engine that is running lean could set this code, however there will likely be other codes present.\n\nAir leaks in exhaust in front of o2 sensor giving false reading\nO2 sensor connector damaged\nO2 sensor signal circuit is shorted to ground\nO2 sensor ground circuit is open\nO2 sensor has failed (it may be contaminated with fuel or coolant)\nPCM has failed \n\nPossible Solutions\nIt's always good to start with checking for air leaks in the exhaust manifold and in the exhaust pipes.\nWith KOER (Key on engine running) use a scan tool or a voltmeter check the o2 sensor signal voltage with engine warm. You may have to increase the RPM to a fast idle to check the voltage of the bank 1,3 sensor. If it's voltage is stuck low (less than a half a volt) and you don't have any other o2 sensor codes present in the PCM, then it's a good bet that the sensor is bad. If the voltage isn't stuck low and the o2 sensor seems to be operating fine, it's likely sticking low intermittently. This often turns out to be the sensor.\nHaving said that, if you're interested in knowing for sure what the problem is then perform the following: 1. Turn off the engine and unplug the 1,3 o2 sensor connector. Make sure that there is battery voltage present and ground present for the o2 sensor heater. If there isn't then diagnose that first then retest. If that checks out then, using a jumper wire, supply a chassis ground to the o2 sensor connector(PCM side) ground circuit. Now observe the scan tool bank 1,3 o2 sensor reading. If it is now at about a half a volt then replace the o2 sensor. If, after supplying a ground to the unplugged PCM side of the o2 sensor connector, the voltage reading doesn't change then check the harness for short to ground.\nCheck for harness making contact with exhaust components. Check pins for damage, and for moisture. Repair as necessary. If you can find no harness problems, then the PCM may be bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nCodes P0131, P0143, and P0151 and fuel pump not startingOn a 99 chevy blazer all three codes came and and fuel pump not running, All 3 sensor deal with O2 sensors- low voltage on different sensors and banks.

  "P0144": {
    "Meaning": "P0144 O2 Sensor Circuit High B1S3",
    "Common Causes": "A P0144 refers to a fault at the post-cat o2 sensor, indicating that the signal voltage is too high. The o2 sensor is a four wire sensor. Two wires are dedicated to the heating element and two wires are dedicated to the sensor. The heating element should have battery voltage on one wire with key on engine off and ground should be present on the other. The PCM supplies a reference voltage to the o2 sensor which the sensor varies according to oxygen content in the exhaust. It is capable of varying between approximately 0.1 and 0.9 volts. This variance in the voltage is monitored by the PCM. The PCM also supplies a ground to the sensor. P0144 means that the voltage was too high on the signal circuit.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0144 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on\nEngine loses power and misses intermittently\nMay exhibit loss of fuel efficiency\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0144 code include:\n\nBad o2 sensor (Bank 1 Sensor 3)\nWiring in contact with exhaust components\nEngine running rich (If other codes are present)\nHoles in exhaust near Bank 1 Sensor 3\nShort to voltage on signal circuit \nBad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nStart the engine and observe the Bank 1 Sensor 3 (a.k.a. 1/3) o2 sensor voltage. You may need to raise the idle up until the o2 sensor starts switching.\nIf it is stuck high, or close to 1 volt and the voltage doesn't vary, then check for a good ground on both the heater element and the sensor. Also check that the heater element is being supplied good battery voltage. No heater operation can cause a sluggish sensor.\nIf the grounds are good and the battery voltage is present, then jumper the sensor's signal wire to the sensor's ground wire. Now the scan tool should read low or near zero volts. If it does, the wiring is good. Replace the bank 1/3 o2 sensor. If jumpering the signal wire to the ground doesn't lower the voltage, then check the o2 sensor wiring harness. Make sure there is no contact with hot exhaust components. Ensure good wiring harness connections. If the wiring checks out, then reperform the previous wiring harness checks at the PCM connector.\nIf now the 1/3 o2 sensor reading drops, then there is a wiring problem that isn't visible. Open the harness and visually inspect the wiring for problems. But if the result is the same, then the PCM may be bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nP0144 on 2007 Mazda 6 2.3lHello everyone.

  "P0145": {
    "Meaning": "P0145 O2 Sensor Circuit Slow Response B1S3",
    "Common Causes": "O2 sensors are constructed using a zirconium dioxide sensing element which is protected by a vented steel housing. The sensing element is connected to wire leads in the O2 sensor wiring harness using platinum electrodes. The PCM is connected to the O2 sensor wiring harness using the controller area network (CAN). The PCM is supplied with data, pertaining to the percentage of oxygen particles in the engine exhaust as compared to the oxygen content of ambient air, by the O2 sensor.\nExhaust gases are pushed into the exhaust pipe and through the catalytic converter; afterward, they pass over the downstream O2 sensor. As exhaust flows through vent holes (in the steel housing) and across the sensing element, ambient air is drawn through the wire lead cavities and into a small chamber in the middle of the sensor. The ambient air (in the chamber) is heated by the exhaust, forcing the oxygen ions to produce (energy) voltage. Deviations between the number of oxygen molecules in ambient air (drawn into the O2 sensor) and the concentration of oxygen ions in the spent exhaust gases cause the voltage to change. These changes cause the oxygen ions inside the O2 sensor to jump between platinum layers very rapidly and repetitiously. \nVoltage variations occur as the rushing oxygen ions jump between platinum layers. The PCM identifies these variations in voltage as changes in exhaust oxygen concentration. These changes indicate that the engine is either running lean (too little fuel) or rich (too much fuel). The voltage signal from the O2 sensor is low when more oxygen is present in the exhaust (lean condition) and high when less oxygen is present in the exhaust (rich condition). This data is used by the PCM primarily to monitor catalytic converter efficiency. If the downstream O2 sensor circuit fails to cycle as expected, over a set period of time and under certain programmed circumstances, a P0145 code will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nSince a P0145 code means that the post catalytic converter O2 sensor has remained slow or unresponsive, it should be addressed at your earliest convenience.\nSymptoms of a P0145 code may include:\n\n A lack of general engine performance\n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Other related diagnostic trouble codes may also be stored \n Service engine soon lamp illumination\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Defective O2 sensor/s \n Burnt, broken, or disconnected wiring and/or connectors \n Clogged catalytic converter \n Engine exhaust leaks\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA diagnostic scanner, digital volt ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source are tools that I would require when diagnosing a code P0145. \nMisfire codes, throttle position sensor codes, manifold air pressure code, and mass air flow sensor codes must be diagnosed and repaired prior to attempting to diagnose a code P0145. If the engine is not running efficiently a successful diagnosis cannot be reached.\nMost skilled technicians begin with a visual inspection of system wiring harnesses and connectors. I would focus on harnesses that are routed near hot exhaust pipes and manifolds, as well as those that are routed near sharp edges like the ones found on exhaust shields. \nRetrieve all stored trouble codes and freeze frame data by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port. Write this information down because it may be helpful if the P0145 proves to be intermittent. Clear the codes and see if the P0145 is reset.\nIf the P0145 is reset, start the engine and let it idle (with the transmission in neutral or park), after allowing it to reach normal operating temperature. Observe O2 sensor input data on the scanner data stream. By narrowing the data stream display to include only pertinent data you can get a more accurate data response.  If the engine is running efficiently, downstream O2 sensor data should reach a mid-line and only fluctuate slightly. If there is little or no fluctuation, a P0145 will be stored.\nTo monitor live data from the O2 sensor, connect the DVOM test leads to the sensor ground and signal wires. The DVOM may also be used to check resistance of the O2 sensor in question, as well as voltage and ground signals. Disconnect related controllers prior to testing system circuit resistance with the DVOM. \nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Once the PCM has entered closed loop operation, the downstream O2 sensor should not cycle as dramatically as upstream sensors but it should cycle regularly \n Low grade replacement catalytic converters are prone to repeated failure and should be avoided\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0146": {
    "Meaning": "P0146 O2 Sensor Circuit (No Activity)",
    "Common Causes": "The o2 sensor is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a reference to the sensor of about half a volt and also supplies a sensor ground and 12 volts for the heater element. The fourth wire is a ground for the heater element (the heater in the sensor helps the sensor to warm up faster which allows the engine to reach closed loop sooner).\nThe sensor varies the supplied reference voltage based on oxygen content of the exhaust. Oxygen sensors are capable of varying between 0.1 volts to 0.9 volts. Lean exhaust produces low voltage and causes the supplied 0.45 volts to drop. Rich exhaust produces high voltage and causes the supplied 0.45 voltage to increase. Pre-catalyst o2 sensors switch between low and high voltage rapidly. However a post-cat o2 sensor may switch much slower & not vary as much (this is normal). If the sensor doesn't respond as it should or there are too few switches in a given time period, P0146 may set. \nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0146 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on\nMay idle or drive poorly\nFuel economy may decrease\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0146 code include:\n\nBad Bank 1, position 3, o2 sensor\nWiring problem, melted harness, broken connectors, etc.\nBad PCM \n\nPossible Solutions\n1. Start the engine and allow it to reach operating temperature. Using a scan tool, observe the Bank 1 position 3 o2 sensor. If it isn't moving between 0.1 and 0.9 volts, increase the engine RPM to a fast idle and then recheck the sensor voltage reading. If it starts switching now, the sensor may be sluggish and/or intermittently going \"dormant\". Replacing the sensor at this point would be a good idea.\nVisually check the o2 sensor for contaminates, etc. If you suspect it's contaminated with coolant or oil, replace it.\na. But, if it still isn't responding after increasing engine RPM, turn off the engine and unplug the 1/3 o2 sensor. With KOEO (key on engine off) check that there is battery voltage and ground to the o2 sensor heater element. If the heater element has no battery voltage it can cause the o2 sensor to go \"dormant\" and not switch properly which can cause a P0146. So, diagnose that problem first(there will usually be other codes present).\nb. If there is power and ground to the heater element check that the sensor ground is present. If it is, connect a jumper wire between the sensor ground and signal wire. Now the 1/3 o2 sensor reading should be low. If so, replace the Bank 1 position 3 o2 sensor.\nc. If, after connecting the jumper wire, the o2 sensor reading still remains \"stuck\", check for wiring problems, harness contacting exhaust components, or broken connectors. Repair as necessary. Then recheck.\nd. If you can find no wiring problems and the o2 sensor reading on the scan tool doesn't change after installing the jumper wire, recheck at the PCM connector. If it still shows no change, the PCM may be at fault.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nError P0146, P0043 on 08 Nissan AltimaHello, \n\nLooking for a little guidance here.

    "Common Causes": "The heater circuit is supplied a 12 V battery feed from the PCM or ignition circuit (depending on model) and a ground.

Connect to ground and touch lead to heater circuit supply. Light should illuminate with KOEO) You should have battery voltage present.\na. If voltage is present, check the ground side of the heater element also making sure a good ground is present. If it is, check for any faulty connections & then replace the o2 sensor. If you don't have a good ground, then there is an open in the ground circuit somewhere that will need to be repaired. Look for wiring harness contact with exhaust components or broken/missing connectors, etc.\nb. If battery voltage isn't present with KOEO, check for a blown fuse supplying the heater elements. You may need to get a wiring diagram for this. If the fuse is blown, you'll need to check for a short to ground on the battery supply circuit before replacing the fuse. If you find none, and replacing the fuse re-establishes battery voltage at the o2 sensor connector, then the o2 sensor may have shorted internally, blowing the fuse. Replace it & recheck. (NOTE: it's possible for an o2 sensor's heater circuit to be open/shorted and the o2 sensor to still function).\nc. If you have no battery voltage present with KOEO and there are no blown fuses supplying the heater circuit, then check for an open on the supply circuit.

  "P0148": {
    "Meaning": "P0148 Fuel Delivery Error",
    "Common Causes": "Clean burning diesel engines use an extremely high degree of fuel pressure. It is strongly recommended that only qualified technicians attempt to diagnose and repair these types of systems. Keep in mind that some states demand that only individuals who have been certified as diesel repair technicians repair high pressure diesel fuel systems. Check your state and local ordinances before proceeding. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\nThe diesel fuel supply pump creates the high pressure required for the direct injection system. An electronically controlled (by the PCM or fuel injection controller) fuel control actuator (FCA) is responsible for regulating fuel pressure to the high pressure chambers of the engine. A fuel pressure sensor (usually located near the FCA) allows the PCM to monitor fuel pressure when the engine is running.\nIf the PCM detects an input signal from the fuel pressure sensor which indicates that fuel pressure is not within a specified range (too low or too high), a code P0148 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nA fuel delivery error may lead to reduced engine performance and possibly engine damage, so a code P0148 should be addressed with some degree of urgency (especially if a strong fuel odor accompanies it).\nSymptoms of a P0148 code may include:\n Decreased fuel efficiency\nDiminished engine performance\nExcessive black smoke from exhaust\nThe strong odor of diesel fuel\nOther fuel and engine drivability related codes may be stored\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n High pressure fuel system leak\nDefective fuel pressure sensor\nFaulty fuel control actuator\nOpen or shorted high pressure fuel supply system wiring and/or connectors\nBad fuel pump\nMalfunctioning fuel pump or PCM power supply relay\nPCM or PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), a direct fuel injection diesel fuel pressure gauge, and a vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) will be required to diagnose a stored code P0148.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. It is a good idea to write this information down just in case you need it later. Now, clear the codes and proceed. If there is a strong odor of diesel fuel, suspect that a fuel leak is at the root of your problem. If a fuel leak is detected, fuel filters and other high pressure fuel system components which have been recently replaced, should be carefully inspected before proceeding. After carefully performing a visual inspection of all fuel delivery lines and components, repair leaks as needed and retest the system to see if the code is reset.\nIf there are no leaks present and the code is reset, carefully use the direct fuel injection diesel fuel pressure gauge to test fuel pressure. If actual fuel pressure fails to comply with manufacturer\u2019s specifications, suspect a defective fuel pump, clogged fuel filter, or bad fuel pump relay. You can test fuel pump operation by using the DVOM to test voltage at the fuel pump connector and listening for fuel pump agitation when voltage is applied. Consult your vehicle information source for voltage stipulations and precautionary data. If voltage is present, as specified and there is no fuel pump agitation, suspect that the fuel pump is defective. If there is no voltage at the fuel pump connector, suspect a fuel pump or PCM relay malfunction or wiring problem.\nIf fuel pressure is normal, use the DVOM to test the fuel pressure sensor and the FCA according to recommendations found in your vehicle information source. \nIf these diagnostic steps prove to be too challenging, you might want to go ahead and replace the FCA and the fuel pressure sensor. The regularity with which they fail and cause this code to be stored, combined with the fact that these parts are usually fairly easily accessible and inexpensive, makes this a feasible consideration. Frankly, it\u2019s what would transpire in most commercial garages.\nIf you are still having problems, use your vehicle information source to search technical service bulletins (TSB) for one that matches your specific vehicle, symptoms, and code/s. The information contained in the TSB may help you to pinpoint the malfunction and rectify the situation.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Knowing whether actual fuel pressure is too low or too high can aid in your diagnosis\nBe very careful when removing the FCA and fuel pressure sensor (diesel fuel pressure is extremely high) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2007 mazda 5 p0148 codeI am new here.

  "P0149": {
    "Meaning": "P0149 Fuel Timing Error",
    "Common Causes": "Most of today\u2019s clean burning, direct injection, diesel engines utilize a mechanical fuel pump that is driven directly off the crankshaft. In order to overcome the high compression ratios associated with diesel engines, this type of pump is timed in sequence with the position of the crankshaft to provide a high pressure injection pulse (up to 44,000 psi) at a precise point and interval, for each cylinder of the engine. The fuel pump is typically small enough to fit underneath the intake manifold and has the low pressure pump, the high pressure pump, the fuel timing solenoid, and the fuel pressure control actuator integrated within. There will likely be a fuel pressure sensor nearby as well.\nThe fuel pump is pulsed using a toothed sprocket which is aligned with a toothed sprocket on the front of the crankshaft. Timing of the two sprockets (using a steel chain) is critical to fuel pump timing and fuel delivery. If the two sprockets are misaligned by even a single tooth, a code P0149 may be stored.\nThe PCM uses inputs related to engine RPM and engine load to calculate fuel timing advance. The electronic fuel timing solenoid is controlled by the PCM and allows direct injection timing to be advanced according to engine speed and load.\nThe electronic fuel pressure regulator is also controlled by the PCM and is responsible for controlling fuel pump pressure. The fuel pressure sensor monitors fuel pressure, with the engine running, and provides the PCM with an actual reading so that it can continue to plot fuel pump timing and monitor fuel pressure requirements. If the PCM detects a fuel pressure input signal, indicating that there is a problem with fuel pump timing, a code P0149 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\nNOTE: Please use extreme caution when attempting to service the high pressure fuel system. This type of system should be serviced only by trained personnel. Consult a reliable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) for more precautions.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nAssuming that the vehicle will start, inconsistencies in fuel pump timing can result in engine damage. A stored code P0149 should be considered severe.\nSymptoms of a P0149 code may include:\n No start condition\nDiminished engine performance\nAdditional fuel system codes\nIntense fuel odor\nThe vehicle may enter imp-in mode\n Excessive smoke from exhaust\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n\n \tDefective fuel timing solenoid\nMisaligned timing marks on mechanical sprockets\nBad fuel pressure sensor\nMalfunctioning fuel pressure control actuator\nFuel system leaks\nFaulty PCM or a PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nAlthough a stored code P0149 may be caused by either a mechanical failure or an electrical issue, mechanical failure is not likely unless recent related repairs have been performed. If the engine and/or the high pressure fuel pump have recently been re-timed, definitely suspect that a misalignment of the corresponding timing marks has taken place and caused this code to be stored.\nBarring a mechanical glitch, you will need a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a vehicle information source like All Data DIY to diagnose a code P0149.\nRetrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector. Write this information down just in case you need it later, then clear the codes and proceed.\nIf there is an intense fuel odor, suspect that a fuel leak is at the root of your problem. Fuel system components which have been recently replaced should be carefully inspected if a fuel leak is detected. Once you have performed a visual inspection of all fuel delivery lines and components, repair leaks as necessary and retest the system to see if the code is reset.\nTest the fuel pressure sensor, fuel control actuator, and the fuel timing solenoid as recommended in your vehicle information source, using the DVOM. Replace components which fail to meet manufacturer\u2019s recommended specifications and retest the system. \nIf you continue to have issues, use your vehicle information source to search technical service bulletins (TSB) for one that matches your specific vehicle, symptoms, and code/s. The information contained therein may help you to pinpoint the malfunction and rectify the situation.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n Suspect mechanical timing issues only if recent repairs have been executed\nCaution: Diesel fuel at 40,000 psi can penetrate your bloodstream and may be fatal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2001 Ford Focus 1,8 TDDI P0149\u010co zapri\u010dinuje chybu P0149 na Forde focus 1,8 tddi 2001,66kw. \nMotor nevykazuje \u017eiadne probl\u00e9my pri chode....\u00a0\nNeed more help with a p0149 code?\nIf you still need help regarding the P0149 trouble code, please post \n  your question in our FREE car repair forums.\nWe are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\nShare\n\n\nNOTE: This information is presented for information purposes only. \n  It is not intended as repair advice and we are not responsible for any actions \n  you take on any vehicle.

  "P0150": {
    "Meaning": "P0150 O2 Sensor Circuit Malfunction Bank 2 Sensor 1",
    "Common Causes": "The ECM constantly monitors this voltage while in closed loop to determine \n  how much fuel to inject. If the ECM determines that the O2 sensor voltage was \n  too low (less than .4 Volts) for too long (for more than 20 seconds (time varies \n  with model)), this code is set. The code P0150 refers to Bank \n    2.\nPotential Symptoms\nDepending if the problem is intermittent or not, there may be no symptoms other \n  than MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination. If the problem is constant, \n  then symptoms may include one or more of the following:\n\nMIL illumination\nEngine runs rough, missing or stumbling\nBlows black smoke from tail pipe\nEngine dies\n Poor fuel economy\n\nCauses\nUsually the cause of P0150 is a bad oxygen sensor, however this isn't always \n  the case. If your o2 sensors haven't been replaced and they are old, it's a \n  good bet that the sensor is the problem. But, It could be caused by any of the \n  following:\n\n Water or corrosion in the connector\nLoose terminals in the connector\nWiring burnt on exhaust components\n Open or short in the wiring due to rubbing on engine components\n Holes in exhaust allowing unmetered oxygen into exhaust system\n Unmetered vacuum leak at the engine\n Bad o2 sensor\n Bad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nUsing a scan tool, determine if the Bank \n  2, sensor 1 is switching properly. It should switch rapidly between rich \n  and lean, evenly.\n1. If it does, the problem is likely intermittent and you should examine the \n  wiring for any visible damage. Then perform a wiggle test by manipulating the \n  connector and wiring while watching the o2 sensor voltage. If it drops out, \n  fix the appropriate part of the wiring harness where problem resides.\n2. If it doesn\\'t switch properly, try to determine if the sensor is accurately \n  reading the exhaust or not. Do this by removing the fuel pressure regulator \n  vacuum supply briefly. The o2 sensor reading should go rich, reacting to the \n  extra fuel added. Reinstall regulator supply. Then induce a lean condition by \n  removing a vacuum supply line from the intake manifold. The o2 sensor reading \n  should go lean, reacting to the enleaned exhaust. If the sensor operates properly, \n  then the sensor may be okay and the problem may be holes in the exhaust or an \n  unmetered vacuum leak in the engine (NOTE: Unmetered vacuum leaks at the engine \n  are almost always accompanied by lean codes. Refer to the appropriate articles \n  for diagnosing an unmetered vacuum leak). If the exhaust does have holes in \n  it, it's possible that the o2 sensor may be misreading the exhaust because of \n  the extra oxygen entering the pipe via those holes\n3. If none of this is the case and the o2 sensor just isn't switching or acts \n  sluggish, unplug the sensor and make sure there is 5 Volt reference voltage \n  to the sensor. Then check for 12V supply to the o2 sensor's heater circuit. \n  Also check for continuity to ground on the ground circuit. If any of these are \n  missing, or aren't their proper voltage, repair open or short in the appropriate \n  wire. The o2 sensor will not operate properly without proper voltage. If the \n  proper voltages are present, replace the o2 sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n1997 Toyota rebuilt engine P0171, P0130, P0133, P0150 and P0153I have a 1997 Toyota that recently had the engine rebuilt and afterwards the engine light came on with codes PO171, PO130, PO133, PO150 & PO153\nNow I know 171 is bank 1 lean & 139 & 133 is bank 1 O2 & 150 & 153 is bank 2ion issue O2\nEvery thing I know is this is a vacuum leak &am...\u00a01996 Nissan Maxima P0150 P0136 P0105 P0130:roll: I own a 1996 Nissan Maxima, automatic, v6.

  "P0152": {
    "Meaning": "P0152 O2 Sensor (High Voltage) B2S1",
    "Common Causes": "A P0152 code refers to the Bank 2, sensor 1, o2 sensor. (Bank 1 would contain cylinder 1 and bank 2 is the opposite bank. Bank 2 doesn't necessarily contain cylinder 2.) \"Bank 2\" refers to the side of the exhaust that DOES NOT contain cylinder number 1 and \"Sensor 1\" indicates that it is the pre-cat sensor, or forward(first) sensor on that bank. It is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a ground circuit and a reference voltage of about .5 volts on another circuit. Also for the o2 heater there is a battery voltage supply wire and another ground circuit for that. The o2 sensor heater allows the o2 sensor to warm up faster, thus achieving closed loop in less time than it would normally take for the exhaust to warm the sensor up to operating temperature.\nThe O2 sensor varies the supplied reference voltage based on oxygen content in the exhaust. It is capable of varying from .1 to .9 volts, .1 indicating lean exhaust and .9 indicating rich exhaust. NOTE: A condensed explanation of fuel trims: If the o2 sensor indicates that the oxygen voltage reading is .9 volts or high, the PCM interprets this as a rich condition in the exhaust and as a result decreases the amount of fuel entering the engine by shortening injector \"on time\". The STFT (short term fuel trims) would reflect this change. The opposite would occur when the PCM sees a lean condition. The PCM would add fuel which would be indicated by a single digit positive STFT reading. On a normal engine the front o2 sensors switch rapidly back and forth two or three times per second and the STFT would shift positive and negative single digits to add and remove fuel to compensate at a similar rate. This little \"dance\" goes on to keep the air/fuel ratio at it's optimal level. Short term fuel trims or STFT reflect immediate changes in fuel injector \"on-time\" while long term fuel trims or LTFT reflect changes in fuel over a longer period of time. If your STFT or LTFT readings are in the positive double digits (ten or above), this indicates the fuel system has been adding an abnormal amount of fuel than is necessary to keep the proper air/fuel ratio. It may be overcompentsating for a vacuum leak or a stuck lean o2 sensor, etc. The opposite would be true if the fuel trim readings are in the negative double digits. It would indicate that the fuel system has been taking away excessive amounts of fuel, perhaps to compensate for leaking injectors or a stuck rich o2 sensor, etc. So when experiencing o2 related issues, reading your fuel trims can indicate what the PCM has been doing over the long term and short term with regard to fuel.\nThis code indicates that the o2 sensor was stuck too high or in the rich position. The PCM monitors this voltage and if it determines that the voltage is too high out of range for too long, P0152 may set. \nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nEngine may run very rough\nEngine may be running lean or rich depending on if the o2 sensor is reading correctly or incorrectly\nLack of power\nIncreased fuel consumption\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0152 code include:\n\nBad bank 2, 1 o2 sensor incorrectly reading rich condition\nEngine running rich and o2 sensor\nCorrectly reading rich condition\nSignal shorted to voltage in harness\nWiring harness damage/melted due to contact with exhaust components\nVacuum leak (make have lean codes (P0171, P0174) present with it)\nLeaking injectors\nBad fuel pressure regulator\nBad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf you have any lean or rich codes associated with this code, focus on fixing these first because these can cause the o2 sensor voltage readings to appear to be faulty when they are in fact only reading correctly.\nSo, with the engine running at operating temperature, use a scan tool to observe the Bank 2,1 o2 sensor voltage reading. Is it high? If so, look at the long term and short term fuel trim readings. The fuel trims are affected by the o2 sensors as noted above. If the LTFT reading for that bank is indicating negative double digits (PCM trying to take away fuel to compensate for problem) try inducing a vacuum leak to see if the sensor voltage then goes lean and the fuel trims increase. If the o2 sensor responds, suspect a problem with the engine, not the sensor. There may be other engine codes to help you.\nIf the o2 sensor reading remains high (0.9 volts or above) and won't respond then shut off engine. With KOEO (Key on engine off) disconnect the o2 sensor and look for signs of corrosion or water intrustion. Repair as necessary. The voltage reading should now be about 0.5 volts. If so, replace the o2 sensor, it's shorted internally.\nIf after unplugging the o2 sensor the voltage reading on the scan tool doesn't change, then suspect wiring problems. Inspect the harness and look for any melted wires or anywhere that the o2 sensor harness is making contact with the exhaust components. If you are unsure, you can check for continuity of all four wires between the sensor and the PCM with an ohmmeter. Any resistance at all indicates a problem. Repair as necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n00 Jeep Grand Cherokee   P0130, P0136, P0152, P0158My 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee (4.7l) had the famous dieing out while driving issue, after many hours of research it seemed replacing the PCM would have highest chance of fixing it.

  "P0154": {
    "Meaning": "P0154 02 Sensor No Activity Circuit B2S1",
    "Common Causes": "The other two wires are dedicated to the oxygen sensor heater element. This heater allows the sensor to warm up faster, which allows the engine to enter closed loop faster, reducing startup emissions. The heater element is supplied a 12v feed from the power distribution center (usually) and a ground.\nThe oxygen content of the exhaust affects the O2 sensor resistance. This resistance produces a counter voltage on the reference/signal wire that the PCM will use to analyze oxygen in the exhaust. Lean exhaust produces low voltage, while rich exhaust produces high voltage. The oxygen sensor is capable of varying between 0.9v (rich) and 0.1v (lean). Once the engine reaches closed loop, the O2 sensor should begin switching rapidly between rich and lean voltages 2-3 times per second. If for some reason the O2 sensor doesn't switch properly or \"sticks\", P0154 may set. This code indicates the O2 sensor isn't operating.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0154 code may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nOther codes indicating rich or lean condition may be present\nPoor idle, won't idle\nMisfire at idle or at highway speed\nEngine may blow black smoke at tailpipe\nFuel economy may decrease\nMay start and stall\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0154 code include:\n\nFaulty bank 2,1 Oxygen sensor\nHoles in exhaust near oxygen sensor\nShort to voltage or ground on signal circuit\nOpen or high resistance in signal circuit\nWiring harness chafing/rubbing on exhaust components\nWater/oil intrusion at O2 sensor connector\nBroken lock or loose terminals on O2 sensor connector\nOil/coolant fouled oxygen sensor\n\nPossible Solutions\nFirst start the engine and bring it up to operating temperature and ensure the engine reaches closed loop. Then, using the live data function on a scan tool, observe the Bank 2,1 oxygen sensor voltage reading. Is it switching properly? If so, the problem may be an intermittently bad sensor or more likely a wiring problem. Visually check the O2 sensor wiring and repair as needed. Does the voltage for the Bank 2,1 oxygen sensor appear to be \"stuck\" and not moving? If so, increase idle speed for 30 seconds or so. If the sensor begins switching after a period of elevated idle, visually check the exhaust for holes or rust near the O2 sensor that could be affecting the voltage reading\n If the exhaust checks out, suspect the sensor to be sluggish and replace it. If the Bank 2,1 oxygen sensor appears to be not switching, turn the engine off, and unplug the Bank 2,1 oxygen sensor. With KOEO (Key on engine off) jumper the O2 sensor signal wire to the ground wire. Now the voltage reading should be low (about 0.1v). If it is, then check for a bad connection at the O2 sensor connector. Repair as necessary. If no bad connection is found, replace the O2 sensor and re-check. If when you jumper the signal wire to the ground wire the voltage reading isn't low (about 0.1v), remove the jumper wire. Now check for voltage at the O2 sensor signal wire. It should have, with KOEO and O2 sensor unplugged, roughly 0.5 volts. If it does, check also for a good ground to the sensor as well. Repair as necessary\n Check for loose connections, water intrusion at PCM connector, etc. If you have no 0.5 volt reference voltage, unplug the PCM connector and ohm the signal circuit and ground circuits. There should be no resistance nor any voltage. Repair excessive resistance. If you still have no 0.5 volt reference voltage, recheck at the PCM connector. It may be necessary to clip the signal wire to eliminate the possibility of a short or open somewhere. If you now have reference voltage present coming out of the PCM, fix open/short in signal circuit. If you have no reference voltage coming out of the PCM, the PCM will have to be diagnosed for a fault. It may be the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2003 silverado repeatedly throwing p0155 and p01542003 Silverado..repeatedly throwing po155, and 154..replaced the the heated sensor twice..code still keeps popping up..found a 4ws fuse blown under the hood..replaced that..found a vacumn leak at the solenoid relay..fixed that..tried unplugging the battery, and drove more than 100 miles..codes still...\u00a0Please help me!

  "P0156": {
    "Meaning": "P0156 O2 Sensor Circuit Malfunction B2S2",
    "Common Causes": "A P0156 code refers to the Bank 2,2 o2 sensor or the downstream (post-cat) o2 sensor on Bank 2. It is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a ground circuit and a reference voltage circuit of about 0.5 volts. Also for the o2 sensor heater element there is a battery voltage supply wire and another ground circuit for that. The o2 sensor heater allows the o2 sensor to warm up faster, thus achieving closed loop in less time than it would normally take for the exhaust to warm the sensor up to operating temperature. The O2 sensor varies the supplied reference voltage based on oxygen content in the exhaust. It is capable of varying from about 0.1 to 0.9 volts, 0.1 V indicating lean exhaust and 0.9 V indicating rich exhaust. This P0156 code indicates that the Bank 2, 2 o2 sensor is stuck low for too long or isn\\'t active at all. \nSymptoms\nOften post-cat o2 sensor problems present few symptoms since they are inputs to the PCM to monitor catalytic converter quality and don\\'t directly control fuel. sometimes no symptoms are noticeable. However the following may be possible on some vehicles:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nDecrease in MPG\nIncrease in tailpipe emissions\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0156 code include:\n\nBad O2 sensor\nSignal shorted to voltage\nWiring problems due to contact with exhaust components\nHoles in exhaust near o2 sensor\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf you have access to a scan tool, check the signal voltage for the Bank 2,2 oxygen sensor with the engine at normal operating temperature. Is it stuck low currently? If so, increase RPM for a few seconds and see if it affects the reading. If it begins working with increased RPM, check for holes in the exhaust near the o2 sensor that may cause a false lean. If the exhaust pipe is intact, the sensor is sluggish, replace it.\nIf the Bank 2,2 o2 sensor voltage reading remains low with increased RPM, unplug it and then observe the reading. It should have increased to about 0.5 volts or thereabouts. If it did, check for water intrusion or other connector problems. If none are found, replace the shorted o2 sensor. If the voltage reading is still stuck low after unplugging the sensor, then suspect a wiring problem. Using a voltmeter, with the o2 sensor unplugged, check for voltage on the signal circuit at the o2 sensor connector(PCM side). It can vary with model, but should be about 0.5 volts and not above 1 volt. If the voltage reading is too high, repair short to voltage on signal circuit. If the signal voltage checks out, suspect the PCM. \n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nHello guys Can anyone help me with P0133, P0156 and P0411Ford Taurus GL 1997, Engine 3.0 EFI\n\nI have these three codes in my car. how can i solve these problems.\n\nP0133 - O2 Sensor Circuit Slow Response (Bank 1 Sensor 1) \nP0156 - O2 Sensor Circuit Slow Response (Bank 2 Sensor 2) \nP0411 - Secondary Air Injection System Incorrect Flow Detected \n\nThanks for ...\u00a02000 F150 5.4l 2V Triton p0156, p0171For the last week I've been getting these two codes and I've replaced both downstream O2 sensors checked for vacuum leaks I replaced both hoses for the pressure sensor that comes off the exhaust on the driver side I've cleaned the mass airflow sensor and clean my K&N air filter and I'm still get...\u00a0F150 V8 CODES P0136, P0156, P1131, P1151On  my way to work one as i came to a light my truck did a kind of hiccup then started running like I had a misfire.

  "P0157": {
    "Meaning": "P0157 O2 Sensor Circuit Low B2S2",
    "Common Causes": "If the PCM sees little or no difference between the exhaust quality in post- and pre- catalyst sensors then it knows that the catalyst is not working properly. To over simplify: a post-cat sensor's main job is to monitor catalyst efficiency, not control fuel management (although they can have a measure of influence over the front o2 sensor's operation, we'll just stick to basics for the sake of simplicity).\nIf you have a P0157, that doesn't mean your catalyst is bad (in fact, it usually never does). This code basically means that the Bank 2, Sensor 2 (or second o2 sensor back on bank 2) signal voltage is below what is considered normal for that sensor. It's a four wire sensor being supplied a 0.5 volt reference voltage (usually on the signal wire) and a ground, as well as a power and ground circuit for the o2 sensor heater element. Changes in oxygen content cause resistance changes in the sensor's signal circuit. This changing resistance affects the 0.5 volts on the signal/reference circuit. A heated o2 sensor is capable of switching between 0.1 volts and 0.9 volts. However, a properly working post-catalyst sensor will exhibit small changes at a slower rate than front (pre-catalyst) o2 sensors. It may switch slightly above and below 0.45 volts at the rate of about 1 switch per second or less(depends on the vehicle). The PCM monitors this changing signal to determine if the catalyst is working properly. If the PCM determines that the post-cat o2 sensor signal voltage is below a certain threshold for too long, P0157 will set. \nSymptoms\nUsually rear o2 sensor problems won't cause drivability issues since they are an input that measures catalyst efficiency (unlike front o2 sensors). However if you have other codes present, like lean codes or pre-o2 sensor codes, then they may cause drivability problems as well as P0143. The following symptoms may be present:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nEngine performance issues\nEngine running rough\nEngine running rich (only if PCM is trying to add fuel to compensate for low o2 sensor voltage reading)\nEngine running lean (only if vacuum leak is large enough that PCM can't compensate by adding fuel)\nPoor idle \n\nCauses\nIf you have reason to believe that your engine is running lean, fix that problem first, then clear codes and see if the P0157 code resets. An engine that is running lean could set this code, but usually there will be lean codes (P0171, P0174) present. The following could be causes:\n\nAir leaks in exhaust in front of o2 sensor giving false reading\nEngine running excessively lean\nO2 sensor connector damaged/corroded\nO2 sensor signal circuit is shorted to ground\nO2 sensor ground circuit is open\nO2 sensor has failed (it may be contaminated with fuel or coolant)\nPCM has failed\n\nPossible Solutions\nIt's always good to start with checking for air leaks in the exhaust manifold and in the exhaust pipes. Fix these first.\nWith KOER (Key on engine running) use a scan tool or a voltmeter check the o2 sensor signal voltage with engine warm. You may have to increase the RPM to a fast idle to check the voltage of the bank 2,2 sensor. If it's voltage is stuck low (less than 0.5 volts may not be enough to set the code, but it depends on the vehicle) and you don't have any other o2 sensor codes present in the PCM, then it's a good bet that the sensor is bad. If the voltage isn't stuck low and the o2 sensor seems to be operating fine, it's likely sticking low intermittently. This often turns out to be the sensor. In either case, replacing the sensor can be an effective way to diagnose the problem. But it can also be an expensive diagnostic tool, especially if it turns out to be a wiring issue, instead of a sensor.\nSo, if you're interested in knowing for sure what the problem is before spending unnecessarily, then perform the following: 1. Turn off the engine and unplug the 2,2 o2 sensor connector. Inspect for corrosion, etc. Repair as necessary. Make sure that there is battery voltage present and ground present for the o2 sensor heater. If there isn't, then diagnose that first then retest. The o2 sensor depends on the heater to warm it up so it can start working quicker. If the heater element is bad or there isn't the proper voltage supplying it, the sensor may set this code. Usually heater problems have codes associated with them, too. If you find there is no battery voltage feeding the o2 sensor use the associated code to diagnose that. If you find the heater element bad, replace the sensor.\nIf the heater element checks out then, using a jumper wire, supply a chassis ground to the o2 sensor connector(PCM side) ground circuit. Now observe the scan tool bank 2,2 o2 sensor reading. If it is now at about a half a volt then replace the o2 sensor. If, after supplying a ground to the unplugged PCM side of the o2 sensor connector, the voltage reading doesn't change then check the harness for short to ground. Check for harness making contact with exhaust components. Check pins for damage, and for moisture. Repair as necessary.

  "P0158": {
    "Meaning": "P0158 O2 Sensor Circuit High B2S2",
    "Common Causes": "A P0158 refers to a fault at the post-cat o2 sensor on bank 2 (second sensor back on bank 2), indicating that the signal voltage is too high. The o2 sensor is a four wire sensor. Two wires are dedicated to the heating element and two wires are dedicated to the sensor. The heating element should have battery voltage on one wire with key on engine off and ground should be present on the other. The PCM supplies a reference voltage of 0.5 volts to the o2 sensor which the sensor varies according to oxygen content in the exhaust. The PCM also supplies a ground to the sensor. Changes in oxygen content cause resistance changes in the o2 sensor. This change in resistance affects the PCM-supplied 0.5 volts. It is capable of varying between approximately 0.1 and 0.9 volts. A reading of 0.1 indicates full lean and 0.9 indicates full rich. This variance in the voltage is monitored by the PCM.\nA P0158 code means that the voltage was higher than normal on the signal circuit. NOTE: A post-catalyst o2 sensor will normally switch slower and fewer times than front (pre-cat) o2 sensors.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0158 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on\nEngine loses power and misses intermittently\nMay exhibit loss of fuel efficiency\nEngine running rich\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0158 code include:\n\nBad o2 sensor (Bank 2 Sensor 2)\nWiring in contact with exhaust components\nEngine running rich (If other codes are present)\nHoles in exhaust causing PCM to over-rich engine resulting in an abnormally high Bank 2, sensor 2 reading\nShort to voltage on signal circuit\nBad PCM \n\nPossible Solutions\nIt's always a good idea to observe the condition of the exhaust components. Inspect for holes, wiring harness making contact with exhaust, etc. Start the engine and observe the Bank 2 Sensor 2 o2 sensor voltage. On rear o2 sensors you may need to raise the idle up until the o2 sensor starts switching if the sensor is sluggish. If raising the idle causes the sensor's voltage to drop, then replace the sensor due to sluggishness. If, after starting the engine and warming to operating temperature, the 2,2 oxygen sensor is observed to be stuck high, or close to 1 volt and the voltage doesn't drop or vary, then turn the engine off.\nWith KOEO (key on engine off) unplug the 2,2 o2 sensor and check for a good ground on both the heater element and the sensor. Also check that the heater element is being supplied good battery voltage. No heater operation can cause a sluggish sensor, but will usually have codes associated with it. If the grounds are good and the battery voltage is present, then jumper the sensor's signal wire to the sensor's ground wire. Now the scan tool should read low or near zero volts. If it does, the wiring is good. Replace the bank 2/2 o2 sensor. If jumpering the signal wire to the ground doesn't lower the voltage, then check the o2 sensor wiring harness. Make sure there is no contact with hot exhaust components. Ensure good wiring harness connections.\nIf the wiring checks out, then recheck the previous wiring harness checks at the PCM connector. It may be necessary to clip the o2 sensor signal wire close to the PCM in a location that is easily accessible so it may be repaired after this test. If now the 2/2 o2 sensor reading drops, then there is a wiring problem that isn't visible. Open the harness and visually inspect the wiring for problems on the signal wire. Or you may choose to run another signal wire by clipping and leaving the offending wire in the harness. But if the result is the same, then the PCM may be at fault.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2005 2500 HD 6.0 Codes P0332 P0158 P00602005 2500HD 6.0 4x4.

  "P0160": {
    "Meaning": "P0160 O2 Sensor Circuit No Activity B2S2",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) compares the post-cat o2 sensor to the pre-cat o2 sensors to measure the cat's efficiency. The o2 sensor is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a reference voltage to the sensor of about half a volt and also supplies a sensor ground. 12 volts are supplied for the heater element and also a ground for the heater element (the heater in the sensor helps the sensor to warm up faster which allows the engine to reach closed loop sooner).\nThe sensor varies the reference voltage the PCM gives it based on oxygen content of the exhaust. The change in oxygen content causes resistance changes in the sensor which affects the 0.5 volt reference voltage. Oxygen sensors are capable of varying the supplied voltage between 0.1 volts to 0.9 volts. Lean exhaust produces low voltage and causes the supplied 0.5 volts to drop. Rich exhaust produces high voltage and causes the supplied 0.5 voltage to increase. Pre-catalyst (front) o2 sensors switch between low and high voltage rapidly one or two times per second.\nHowever this sensor is a post-cat o2 sensor and may switch much slower & not vary as much (this is normal). If the sensor \"sticks\" or there are too few switches in a given time period, P0160 may set.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0160 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on\nMay idle or drive poorly\nFuel economy may decrease\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0160 code include:\n\nHoles in exhaust near post cat o2 sensor\nBad Bank 2, position 2, o2 sensor\nWiring problem, melted harness, broken connectors, etc.\nBad PCM \n\nPossible Solutions\nIt's always best to do a visual inspection of the exhaust system first. Look for holes near o2 sensors or wiring harnesses coming in contact with exhaust components. Repair as necessary.\n1. Start the engine and allow it to reach operating temperature. Using a scan tool, observe the Bank 2 position 2 o2 sensor. If it isn't moving at all this doesn't necessarily mean that anythings wrong. Post cat o2 sensors often switch very little. Increase the engine RPM to a fast idle and then recheck the sensor voltage reading. If it starts switching now, the sensor may be sluggish and/or intermittently going \"dormant\". Replacing the sensor at this point would be a good idea. Visually check the o2 sensor for contaminates, etc. If you suspect it's contaminated with coolant or oil, replace it. But, if it still isn't responding after increasing engine RPM, turn off the engine and unplug the 2/2 o2 sensor. With KOEO (key on engine off) check that there is 12 Volts battery voltage and a good ground to the o2 sensor heater element. If the heater element has no battery voltage it can cause the o2 sensor to be sluggish and not switch properly which can cause a P0160.\nSo, diagnose that problem first(there will usually be other codes present). If there is power and ground to the heater element check that the sensor ground is present. If it is, connect a jumper wire between the sensor ground and signal wire. Now the 2/2 o2 sensor reading should be low. If so, replace the Bank 2 position 2 o2 sensor. If, after connecting the jumper wire, the o2 sensor reading still remains \"stuck\", check for wiring problems, harness contacting exhaust components, or broken connectors. Repair as necessary. Then recheck. If you can find no wiring problems and the o2 sensor reading on the scan tool doesn't change after installing the jumper wire, recheck at the PCM connector. It may be necessary to clip the signal wire near the PCM in a location that will be easy to repair. If it now shows a low voltage reading, then you know beyond a doubt that there is a wiring problem. At this point clipping the offending wire out of the harness and running a new one may be your best bet. But If it still shows no change, the PCM may be at fault.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nP0160  1996 GMC 3500 5.7Hello, I have tools, readers and some knowhow.

  "P0162": {
    "Meaning": "P0162 O2 Sensor Circuit Malfunction B2S3",
    "Common Causes": "Fouled or faulty O2 sensors can cause the PCM to add or take away fuel based on the faulty O2 sensor data which can cause a false lean or rich condition. A P0162 code refers to the Bank 2,3 O2 sensor, or the third sensor downstream (post-cat) on Bank 2. It is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a ground circuit and a reference voltage circuit of about 0.5 volts or half a volt. Also for the O2 sensor heater element there is a battery voltage supply wire (usually from the power distribution center) and another ground circuit for that. The O2 sensor heater allows the O2 sensor to warm up faster, thus achieving closed loop in less time than it would normally take for the exhaust to warm the sensor up to operating temperature. This creates less exhaust emissions at cold startup. The O2 sensor varies the supplied reference voltage based on oxygen content in the exhaust. It is capable of varying from about 0.1 to 0.9 volts, 0.1 V indicating lean exhaust and 0.9 V indicating rich exhaust. This P0162 code indicates that the Bank 2, 3 O2 sensor is stuck low for too long or is inactive. \nSymptoms\nOften post-cat O2 sensor problems present few drivability issues since they are inputs to the PCM to monitor catalytic converter quality and don't directly control fuel. Sometimes no symptoms are noticeable. However the following may be possible on some vehicles: \n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nDecrease in MPG\nIncrease in tailpipe emissions\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0162 code include:\n\nBad O2 sensor\nSignal shorted to voltage \nWiring problems due to contact with exhaust components\nHoles in exhaust near O2 sensor \n\nPossible Solutions\nWarm the engine up to normal operating temperature. Using your scan tool's live datastream, check the signal voltage for the Bank 2,3 O2 sensor at idle. Is it stuck low and not switching? If so, increase engine RPMs for a minute or so and observe if the sensor begins switching or changing voltage. If it does after a period of elevated idle, check under the vehicle for rusty exhaust components or holes in the exhaust near the O2 sensor(s). Repair as necessary. If the exhaust is intact, then suspect a sluggish Bank 2,3 O2 sensor and replace it. If you observe that the O2 sensor remains low on the datastream, then unplug it and observe the reading. It should now be showing reference voltage, or half a volt (0.5 v). If it does, check for connector problems, water intrusion, damage to the sensor, etc. If all is okay, replace the faulty Bank 2,3 O2 sensor.\nIf the voltage reading is still low after unplugging the O2 sensor, then suspect a problem with the wiring. Visually inspect the wiring harness making sure that there is no contact with hot exhaust components and that all the harness retainers are in place. Repair as necessary If no wiring harness issues exist, use a voltmeter to check for reference voltage from the PCM at the unplugged connector. It should be reading reference voltage, or about half a volt (0.5v). If voltage reading is too high, repair the short to voltage on the signal circuit. \n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0163": {
    "Meaning": "P0163 O2 Oxygen Sensor Circuit Low B2S3",
    "Common Causes": "To over simplify: a post-cat sensor's main job is to monitor catalyst efficiency, not control fuel management. If you have a P0163, that doesn't mean your catalyst is bad (in fact, it usually never does). This code basically means that the Bank 2, Sensor 3 (or third o2 sensor back on bank 2) signal voltage is below what is considered normal for that sensor. It's a four wire sensor being supplied a 0.5 volt reference voltage on the signal wire and a ground, as well as a power and ground circuit for the o2 sensor heater element. Changes in oxygen content cause resistance changes inside the sensor. This changing resistance affects the 0.5 volts on the signal/reference circuit.\nA heated o2 sensor is capable of switching between 0.1 volts and 0.9 volts with 0.1 volts indicating lean and 0.9 volts indicating rich. However, a properly working post-catalyst sensor will exhibit small changes at a slower rate than front (pre-catalyst) O2 sensors. It may switch slightly above and below 0.45 volts at the rate of about 1 switch per second or less. The PCM monitors this signal change to determine if the catalyst is working properly. If the PCM determines that the Bank 2,3 O2 sensor signal voltage is below a certain threshold for too long, P0163 will set. \nSymptoms\nRear O2 sensor problems won't usually cause drivability issues since they are an input that measures catalyst efficiency (unlike front O2 sensors). However if you have other codes present, like lean codes or pre-O2 sensor codes, then they may cause drivability problems. The following symptoms may be present:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nEngine performance issues\nEngine running rough\nEngine running rich (only if PCM is trying to add fuel to compensate for low O2 sensor voltage reading)\nEngine running lean (only if vacuum leak is large enough that PCM can't compensate by adding fuel) \nPoor idle\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0163 code include:\n\nAir leaks in exhaust in front of O2 sensor giving false reading\nEngine running excessively lean\nO2 sensor connector damaged/corroded\nO2 sensor signal circuit is shorted to ground\nO2 sensor ground circuit is open\nO2 sensor has failed (it may be contaminated with fuel or coolant)\nPCM has failed \n\nPossible Solutions\nIt's always good to start with checking for air leaks in the exhaust manifold and in the exhaust pipes. Fix these first. With KOER (Key on engine running) use a scan tool or a voltmeter check the O2 sensor signal voltage with engine warm. You may have to increase the RPM to a fast idle to check the voltage of the bank 2,3 sensor. If it's voltage is stuck low (less than 0.5 volts) and you don't have any other O2 sensor codes present in the PCM, then the sensor is probably bad. If the voltage isn't stuck low and the O2 sensor seems to be operating fine, it's likely sticking low intermittently. This often turns out to be the sensor. In either case, replacing the sensor can be an effective way to diagnose the problem. But it can also be an expensive diagnostic tool, especially if it turns out to be a wiring issue, instead of a sensor.\nSo, if you're interested in knowing for sure what the problem is before spending unnecessarily, then perform the following: 1. Turn off the engine and unplug the 2,3 O2 sensor connector. Inspect for corrosion, etc. Repair as necessary. Make sure that there is battery voltage present and ground present for the O2 sensor heater. If there isn't, then diagnose that first then retest. The O2 sensor depends on the heater to warm it up so it can start working quicker. If the heater element is bad or there isn't the proper voltage supplying it, the sensor may set this code. Usually heater problems have codes associated with them, too. If you find there is no battery voltage feeding the O2 sensor use the associated code to diagnose that. If you find the heater element bad, replace the sensor. If the heater element checks out then, using a jumper wire, supply a chassis ground to the O2 sensor connector (PCM side) ground circuit. Now observe the scan tool bank 2,3 O2 sensor reading. If it is now at about a half a volt then replace the O2 sensor.\nIf, after supplying a ground to the unplugged PCM side of the O2 sensor connector, the voltage reading doesn't change then check the harness for short to ground. Check for harness making contact with exhaust components. Check pins for damage, and for moisture. Repair as necessary. If you can find no harness problems, then the PCM may be at fault.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0164": {
    "Meaning": "P0164 O2 Sensor Circuit High B2S3",
    "Common Causes": "A P0164 refers to a fault at the post-cat O2 sensor, indicating that the signal voltage is too high. The O2 sensor is a four wire sensor. Two wires are dedicated to the heating element and two wires are dedicated to the sensor. The heating element should have battery voltage on one wire with key on engine off and ground should be present on the other. The PCM supplies a reference voltage to the O2 sensor which the sensor varies according to oxygen content in the exhaust. It is capable of varying between approximately 0.1 and 0.9 volts. This variance in the voltage is monitored by the PCM. The PCM also supplies a ground to the sensor. P0164 means that the voltage was too high on the signal circuit. Bank 2 is the side of the engine that doesn't contain cylinder #1.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0164 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on\nEngine loses power and misses intermittently\nMay exhibit loss of fuel efficiency\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0164 code include:\n\nBad O2 sensor (Bank 2 Sensor 3)\nWiring in contact with exhaust components\nEngine running rich (If other codes are present)\nHoles in exhaust near Bank 2 Sensor 3\nShort to voltage on signal circuit \nBad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nStart the engine and observe the Bank 2 Sensor 3 (a.k.a. 2/3) O2 sensor voltage. You may need to raise the idle up until the O2 sensor starts switching.\nIf it is stuck high, or close to 1 volt and the voltage doesn't vary, then check for a good ground on both the heater element and the sensor. Also check that the heater element is being supplied good battery voltage. No heater operation can cause a sluggish sensor.\nIf the grounds are good and the battery voltage is present, then jumper the sensor's signal wire to the sensor's ground wire. Now the scan tool should read low or near zero volts. If it does, the wiring is good. Replace the bank 2/3 O2 sensor. If jumpering the signal wire to the ground doesn't lower the voltage, then check the O2 sensor wiring harness. Make sure there is no contact with hot exhaust components. Ensure good wiring harness connections. If the wiring checks out, then reperform the previous wiring harness checks at the PCM connector.\nIf now the 2/3 O2 sensor reading drops, then there is a wiring problem that isn't visible. Open the harness and visually inspect the wiring for problems. But if the result is the same, then the PCM may be bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0165": {
    "Meaning": "P0165 O2 Sensor Circuit Slow Response B2S3",
    "Common Causes": "O2 sensors are constructed using a zirconium dioxide sensing element which is protected by a vented steel housing. The sensing element is connected to wire leads in the O2 sensor wiring harness using platinum electrodes. The PCM is connected to the O2 sensor wiring harness using the controller area network (CAN). The PCM is supplied with data, pertaining to the percentage of oxygen particles in the engine exhaust as compared to the oxygen content of ambient air, by the O2 sensor.\nExhaust gases are pushed into the exhaust pipe and through the catalytic converter; afterward, they pass over the downstream O2 sensor. As exhaust flows through vent holes (in the steel housing) and across the sensing element, ambient air is drawn through the wire lead cavities and into a small chamber in the middle of the sensor. The ambient air (in the chamber) is heated by the exhaust, forcing the oxygen ions to produce (energy) voltage. Deviations between the number of oxygen molecules in ambient air (drawn into the O2 sensor) and the concentration of oxygen ions in the spent exhaust gases cause the voltage to change. These changes cause the oxygen ions inside the O2 sensor to jump between platinum layers very rapidly and repetitiously. \nVoltage variations occur as the rushing oxygen ions jump between platinum layers. The PCM identifies these variations in voltage as changes in exhaust oxygen concentration. These changes indicate that the engine is either running lean (too little fuel) or rich (too much fuel). The voltage signal from the O2 sensor is low when more oxygen is present in the exhaust (lean condition) and high when less oxygen is present in the exhaust (rich condition). This data is used by the PCM primarily to monitor catalytic converter efficiency. If the downstream O2 sensor circuit fails to cycle as expected, over a set period of time and under certain programmed circumstances, a P0165 code will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nSince a P0165 code means that the post catalytic converter O2 sensor has remained slow or unresponsive, it should be addressed at your earliest convenience.\nSymptoms of a P0165 code may include:\n\n A lack of general engine performance\n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Other related diagnostic trouble codes may also be stored \n Service engine soon lamp illumination\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Defective O2 sensor/s \n Burnt, broken, or disconnected wiring and/or connectors \n Clogged catalytic converter \n Engine exhaust leaks\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA diagnostic scanner, digital volt ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source are tools that I would require when diagnosing a code P0165. \nMisfire codes, throttle position sensor codes, manifold air pressure code, and mass air flow sensor codes must be diagnosed and repaired prior to attempting to diagnose a code P0165. If the engine is not running efficiently a successful diagnosis cannot be reached.\nMost skilled technicians begin with a visual inspection of system wiring harnesses and connectors. I would focus on harnesses that are routed near hot exhaust pipes and manifolds, as well as those that are routed near sharp edges like the ones found on exhaust shields. \nRetrieve all stored trouble codes and freeze frame data by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port. Write this information down because it may be helpful if the P0165 proves to be intermittent. Clear the codes and see if the P0165 is reset.\nIf the P0165 is reset, start the engine and let it idle (with the transmission in neutral or park), after allowing it to reach normal operating temperature. Observe O2 sensor input data on the scanner data stream. By narrowing the data stream display to include only pertinent data you can get a more accurate data response.  If the engine is running efficiently, downstream O2 sensor data should reach a mid-line and only fluctuate slightly. If there is little or no fluctuation, a P0165 will be stored.\nTo monitor live data from the O2 sensor, connect the DVOM test leads to the sensor ground and signal wires. The DVOM may also be used to check resistance of the O2 sensor in question, as well as voltage and ground signals. Disconnect related controllers prior to testing system circuit resistance with the DVOM. \nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Once the PCM has entered closed loop operation, the downstream O2 sensor should not cycle as dramatically as upstream sensors but it should cycle regularly \n Low grade replacement catalytic converters are prone to repeated failure and should be avoided\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0166": {
    "Meaning": "P0166 O2 Sensor Circuit No Activity B1S3",
    "Common Causes": "The o2 sensor is a four wire sensor. The PCM supplies a reference to the sensor of about half a volt and also supplies a sensor ground and 12 volts for the heater element. The fourth wire is a ground for the heater element (the heater in the sensor helps the sensor to warm up faster which allows the engine to reach closed loop sooner).\nThe sensor varies the supplied reference voltage based on oxygen content of the exhaust. Oxygen sensors are capable of varying between 0.1 volts to 0.9 volts. Lean exhaust produces low voltage and causes the supplied 0.45 volts to drop. Rich exhaust produces high voltage and causes the supplied 0.45 voltage to increase. Pre-catalyst o2 sensors switch between low and high voltage rapidly. However a post-cat o2 sensor may switch much slower & not vary as much (this is normal). If the sensor doesn't respond as it should or there are too few switches in a given time period, P0166 may set. Bank 2 is the side of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0166 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on\nMay idle or drive poorly\nFuel economy may decrease\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0166 code include:\n\nBad Bank 2, position 3, o2 sensor\nWiring problem, melted harness, broken connectors, etc.\nBad PCM \n\nPossible Solutions\n1. Start the engine and allow it to reach operating temperature. Using a scan tool, observe the Bank 2 position 3 o2 sensor. If it isn't moving between 0.1 and 0.9 volts, increase the engine RPM to a fast idle and then recheck the sensor voltage reading. If it starts switching now, the sensor may be sluggish and/or intermittently going \"dormant\". Replacing the sensor at this point would be a good idea.\nVisually check the o2 sensor for contaminates, etc. If you suspect it's contaminated with coolant or oil, replace it.\na. But, if it still isn't responding after increasing engine RPM, turn off the engine and unplug the 1/3 o2 sensor. With KOEO (key on engine off) check that there is battery voltage and ground to the o2 sensor heater element. If the heater element has no battery voltage it can cause the o2 sensor to go \"dormant\" and not switch properly which can cause a P0166. So, diagnose that problem first(there will usually be other codes present).\nb. If there is power and ground to the heater element check that the sensor ground is present. If it is, connect a jumper wire between the sensor ground and signal wire. Now the 1/3 o2 sensor reading should be low. If so, replace the Bank 2 position 3 o2 sensor.\nc. If, after connecting the jumper wire, the o2 sensor reading still remains \"stuck\", check for wiring problems, harness contacting exhaust components, or broken connectors. Repair as necessary. Then recheck.\nd. If you can find no wiring problems and the o2 sensor reading on the scan tool doesn't change after installing the jumper wire, recheck at the PCM connector. If it still shows no change, the PCM may be at fault.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0167": {
    "Meaning": "P0167 O2 Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction B2S3",
    "Common Causes": "The heater circuit is supplied a 12 V battery feed from the PCM or ignition circuit (depending on model) and a ground. The PCM (powertrain control module) monitors how long it takes for the sensors to become active after engine start-up. If it takes too long for the o2 sensors to reach operating temperature, this P0167 can set. Bank 2 is the side of the engine that does not contain cylinder #1.\nSymptoms\nFor this particular O2 sensor, there may be no noticeable symptoms other than:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nPoor/ rough idle\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0167 code include:\n\nBad o2 sensor heater circuit\nBad o2 sensor\nWiring harness problems \n\nPossible Solutions\nUnplug the Bank 1, 3 sensor. With KOEO (key on engine off) use a voltmeter to check for battery voltage present at the o2 sensor connector (PCM side). (You can also do this with a test light. Connect to ground and touch lead to heater circuit supply. Light should illuminate with KOEO) You should have battery voltage present.\na. If voltage is present, check the ground side of the heater element also making sure a good ground is present. If it is, check for any faulty connections & then replace the o2 sensor. If you don't have a good ground, then there is an open in the ground circuit somewhere that will need to be repaired. Look for wiring harness contact with exhaust components or broken/missing connectors, etc.\nb. If battery voltage isn't present with KOEO, check for a blown fuse supplying the heater elements. You may need to get a wiring diagram for this. If the fuse is blown, you'll need to check for a short to ground on the battery supply circuit before replacing the fuse. If you find none, and replacing the fuse re-establishes battery voltage at the o2 sensor connector, then the o2 sensor may have shorted internally, blowing the fuse. Replace it & recheck. (NOTE: it's possible for an o2 sensor's heater circuit to be open/shorted and the o2 sensor to still function).\nc. If you have no battery voltage present with KOEO and there are no blown fuses supplying the heater circuit, then check for an open on the supply circuit. You can do this by ohming the circuit with the o2 sensor unplugged and the PCM unplugged.

  "P0168": {
    "Meaning": "P0168 Fuel Temperature Too High",
    "Common Causes": "The fuel temperature sensor is usually integrated into the fuel composition sensor. It is a small computerized device (that resembles a fuel filter) designed to provide the PCM with an accurate fuel composition and fuel temperature analysis. \nFuel which passes through the inline sensor is electronically analyzed to determine the degree of ethanol, water, and unknown contaminants (non-fuel) found therein. The fuel composition sensor not only analyzes fuel composition but also measures fuel temperature and inputs an electrical signal to the PCM that reflects not only what contaminants are present (and to what degree the fuel has been contaminated) but also the temperature of the fuel. The degree of fuel contamination is analyzed, according to the percentage of contaminants to fuel; generating a voltage signature in the fuel composition/temperature sensor. \nThe voltage signature is input to the PCM as square waveforms of voltage. Waveform patterns vary in frequency depending upon the degree of contamination present in the fuel. The closer the waveform frequency, the higher the degree of fuel contamination; this composes the vertical portion of the waveform. The fuel composition sensor analyzes the amount of ethanol present in fuel separately from other contaminants.  Pulse width, or the horizontal portion of the waveform, is indicative of the voltage signature created by fuel temperature. The higher the temperature of the fuel passing through the fuel temperature sensor; the more rapid the pulse width. Typical pulse width modulation varies between one and five-milliseconds or hundredths-of-a-second. \nIf the PCM detects an input signal from the fuel temperature/composition sensor that indicates that fuel temperature is too high, a P0168 code will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) may be required for MIL illumination on certain models.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nA stored code P0168 should be treated as severe because fuel temperature is used by the PCM to calculate fuel delivery strategy in flex fuel vehicles.\nSymptoms of this code may include:\n\n Usually no symptoms accompany a code P0168\nOther fuel composition codes may be present\nMIL illumination will eventually occur\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Defective fuel composition/temperature sensor\nA bad ambient temperature sensor\nFaulty intake air temperature sensor\nOpen, shorted, or damaged wiring or connectors\nPCM or a PCM programing error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle.

A diagnostic scanner with an integrated DVOM and a portable oscilloscope would serve you well in this situation.\nTo increase your chances of a successful diagnosis, start with a visual inspection of all related wiring harnesses and connectors. You will need to repair or replace damaged or burnt components as required and retest the system. \nMost fuel temperature sensors are supplied with a five-volt reference signal and a ground. As a variable resistance sensor, the fuel temperature sensor completes the circuit and provides the PCM with the appropriate waveform signal as fuel flows through. Using the DVOM, test reference voltage and ground at the fuel temp sensor connector. If there is no reference voltage, use the DVOM to test the corresponding circuits at the PCM connector. If a reference voltage signal is detected at the PCM connector, repair open circuits as required. Caution: Disconnect all related controllers prior to testing circuit resistance with the DVOM. \nSuspect a faulty PCM (or a programming error) if no reference voltage is present at the PCM connector. If there is no fuel temp sensor ground, use your vehicle information source and locate the appropriate ground to make sure that it is secure. \nUse the oscilloscope to observe live data in the form of waveform patterns if the reference and ground are present at the fuel temperature sensor connector. Connect the test leads of to the appropriate circuits and observe the display screen. Measure actual fuel temperature, using the infrared thermometer and compare the results with the temperature reflected by the waveform patterns on the oscilloscope. If the fuel temperature reflected on the oscilloscope fails to coincide with that of the infrared thermometer, suspect that the fuel temperature sensor is defective.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Use the DVOM to test fuel temperature sensor resistance according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations\nIf actual fuel temperature is higher than acceptable, check for shorted wiring or improperly routed exhaust near the fuel tank or supply lines \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2002 Dodge Grand Caravan - P01684, P0442, P0455, P0456The fault codes show there is leak in the evaprative system.

  "P0170": {
    "Meaning": "P0170 Fuel Trim Malfunction (Bank 1)",
    "Common Causes": "It also indicates that the fuel trims reached their limit of adding fuel while trying to compensate for a actual or perceived rich condition. When the fuel trims reach their rich correction limit, the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) sets a P0170, indicating a problem or malfunction in the fuel trims. It may also have a P0173 referring to the same malfunction but on bank two. \nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0170 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) Illumination\nStart and stall\nPoor fuel economy\nBlack smoke at tailpipe\nHesitation/misfire at idle or under load\n\nCauses\nPotential causes include a vacuum leak, unmetered air leaks Fuel saturated engine oil Leak in turbo air charge hoses (if equipped) Possibly bad O2 sensor (If Mercedes, may require adaptation with M-Benz compatible scan tool.) Oil contamination in MAF connector or O2 sensor connectors. Also check ignition coils, cam and crank sensors, and oil sensor for leakage contributing to oil intrusion in wiring harness. Defective MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor (especially on Mercedez-Benz and other European autos. There are a lot of problems with aftermarket MAF sensors.) Defective fuel pressure regulator Leaking camshaft adjuster solenoids (Mercedes-Benz).\nNOTE: for some Mercedes-Benz models there is a service recall for a crankcase vent hose located under the intake manifold. It should be checked for leaks/cracking and also operation of check valve in the hose. The check valve should flow only one way. \nPossible Solutions\nIt should be stated right off the bat that the most common problem associated with this code is the MAF sensor or air mass meter. This is especially the case with Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and other European cars. At time of writing, you don't normally see this code with American-made cars, and minimally with Asian, and, to be honest, I have no idea why. It appears to me that the PCM (powertrain control module) logic used by some European car manufacturers to set a P0170 (or P0173) fault code simply isn't used by American vehicle manufacturers. It is more common to see P0171, 0174, 0172, 0175 codes set with regard to fuel trim malfunctions on American cars. There is very little information on the setting conditions for a P0170, or P0173, but what information that is available almost seems to be a redundancy of the P0171,4,2 & 5 setting conditions. I'm sure there's a reason for it, but I can't get anyone to tell me what that is. The similarities between them may be why we don't see this code surface on domestic vehicles very often. It's simply unnecessary. So, simply put, if you have a P0170, your PCM noticed that the fuel trims reached their rich correction limit. Basically it's adding fuel to try to compensate for a lean condition, real or perceived.\nIf you have this code and access to a scan tool, observe the MAF sensor reading in grams/sec. The reading will be different for different automobiles, so get a good spec. I'm going to stick with what would be normal for a Mercedes (1.8L), since they have the bulk of the trouble. Expect to see at idle 3.5-5 g/s (ideally). At 2500 RPMs with no load it should be between 9 and 12 g/s. On road test, at WOT (wide open throttle) it should be 90 g/s or well above. If it's not in specs, replace it. Be careful of Ebay MAFs. Often they don't work according to OE specifications. If the MAF checks out and there is no oil intrusion at the connector, check fuel pressure and ensure that there are no leaks at the regulator internally or externally. Check all vacuum hoses and confirm none are cracked, disconnected or missing. Make sure there are no vacuum leaks at the intake manifold gaskets or tears in the air supply hose. If the engine is turbo charged, be sure the hoses are in good condition and have no leaks. Leaking turbo pressure hoses could cause a rich condition. Inspect the condition of crankcase vent hose under intake manifold and operation of check valve in the hose. (In the \"What are the causes?\" section) If there doesn't appear to be any problems with the fuel pressure, MAF or vacuum hoses, then inspect the O2 sensor connectors for oil intrusion. A bad O2 sensor could cause a P0170, or P0173. Repair cause of oil leak and replace oil-fouled O2 sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2003 Kia Rio 1.6L P0447, P0038, P0138, P0170, P0501Among several codes my car has, one is P0447 which is listed as EVAP emission system - vent control valve circuit open.\n\nNo idea as to where to start checking as i am not sure if this car has a sensor in the fuel tank.

  "P0173": {
    "Meaning": "P0173 Fuel Trim Malfunction (Bank 2)",
    "Common Causes": "It also indicates that the fuel trims reached their limit of adding fuel while trying to compensate for a actual or perceived rich condition. When the fuel trims reach their rich correction limit, the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) sets a P0173, indicating a problem or malfunction in the fuel trims. It may also have a P0170 referring to the same malfunction but on bank one. \nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0173 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) Illumination\nStart and stall\nPoor fuel economy\nBlack smoke at tailpipe\nHesitation/misfire at idle or under load\n\nCauses\nPotential causes include a vacuum leak, unmetered air leaks Fuel saturated engine oil Leak in turbo air charge hoses (if equipped) Possibly bad O2 sensor (If Mercedes, may require adaptation with M-Benz compatible scan tool.) Oil contamination in MAF connector or O2 sensor connectors. Also check ignition coils, cam and crank sensors, and oil sensor for leakage contributing to oil intrusion in wiring harness. Defective MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor (especially on Mercedez-Benz and other European autos. There are a lot of problems with aftermarket MAF sensors.) Defective fuel pressure regulator Leaking camshaft adjuster solenoids (Mercedes-Benz).\nNOTE: for some Mercedes-Benz models there is a service recall for a crankcase vent hose located under the intake manifold. It should be checked for leaks/cracking and also operation of check valve in the hose. The check valve should flow only one way. \nPossible Solutions\nIt should be stated right off the bat that the most common problem associated with this code is the MAF sensor or air mass meter. This is especially the case with Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and other European cars. At time of writing, you don't normally see this code with American-made cars, and minimally with Asian, and, to be honest, I have no idea why. It appears to me that the PCM (powertrain control module) logic used by some European car manufacturers to set a P0173 (or P0173) fault code simply isn't used by American vehicle manufacturers. It is more common to see P0171, 0174, 0172, 0175 codes set with regard to fuel trim malfunctions on American cars. There is very little information on the setting conditions for a P0173, or P0173, but what information that is available almost seems to be a redundancy of the P0171,4,2 & 5 setting conditions. I'm sure there's a reason for it, but I can't get anyone to tell me what that is. The similarities between them may be why we don't see this code surface on domestic vehicles very often. It's simply unnecessary. So, simply put, if you have a P0173, your PCM noticed that the fuel trims reached their rich correction limit. Basically it's adding fuel to try to compensate for a lean condition, real or perceived.\nIf you have this code and access to a scan tool, observe the MAF sensor reading in grams/sec. The reading will be different for different automobiles, so get a good spec. I'm going to stick with what would be normal for a Mercedes (1.8L), since they have the bulk of the trouble. Expect to see at idle 3.5-5 g/s (ideally). At 2500 RPMs with no load it should be between 9 and 12 g/s. On road test, at WOT (wide open throttle) it should be 90 g/s or well above. If it's not in specs, replace it. Be careful of Ebay MAFs. Often they don't work according to OE specifications. If the MAF checks out and there is no oil intrusion at the connector, check fuel pressure and ensure that there are no leaks at the regulator internally or externally. Check all vacuum hoses and confirm none are cracked, disconnected or missing. Make sure there are no vacuum leaks at the intake manifold gaskets or tears in the air supply hose. If the engine is turbo charged, be sure the hoses are in good condition and have no leaks. Leaking turbo pressure hoses could cause a rich condition. Inspect the condition of crankcase vent hose under intake manifold and operation of check valve in the hose. (In the \"What are the causes?\" section) If there doesn't appear to be any problems with the fuel pressure, MAF or vacuum hoses, then inspect the O2 sensor connectors for oil intrusion. A bad O2 sensor could cause a P0170, or P0173. Repair cause of oil leak and replace oil-fouled O2 sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nMontero sport 2000 xls has p0125 and p0173 already change thermostatPlease help me i have my 2000 montero sport xls and i have code p0125 and p0173 please help dont have idea about cars. \n\nThank you...\u00a01998 Mitsubishi 3000GT, P0173 P0170Hey everyone!\n\nNew to this forum, found it in looking for answers to a very frustrating issue I've been having with my car.\nFacts:\n1998 Mitsubishi 3000GT\n3.0L V6, SOHC 6G72\n185,xxx miles\nManual Transmission\n\nI've been throwing P0173 and P0170..

    "Meaning": "P0180 Fuel Temperature Sensor A Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "The fuel temperature sensor is typically integrated into a single housing (along with the flex fuel sensor) known as a fuel composition sensor. It is actually a small computerized device designed to provide the PCM with an accurate fuel composition and fuel temperature reading. \nFuel which passes through the inline sensor is monitored to determine what degree of ethanol, water, and other contaminants is present. The fuel composition sensor calculates fuel composition and fuel temperature and inputs an electrical signal to the PCM that reflects not only what contaminants are present but also to what degree the fuel has been contaminated. The contamination is measured according to the percentage of contaminants to fuel and is received by the PCM as a square waveform of voltage. The waveform pattern varies in frequency depending upon the degree of contaminants present in the fuel; the closer the waveform frequency, the higher the degree of fuel contamination. This composes the vertical portion of the waveform. The fuel composition sensor monitors the amount of ethanol present in the fuel separately from other contaminants. Flex fuel vehicles are designed to function efficiently when fuel composition levels are as high as eighty-five-percent ethanol.\nThe horizontal portion of the waveform, or the pulse width, indicates fuel temperature. The greater the pulse width speed, the higher the temperature of the fuel passing through the fuel composition sensor. Pulse width modulation varies (on most applications) between one and five-milliseconds (hundredths-of-a-second). \nIf the PCM detects an input signal from the fuel composition sensor that indicates that the fuel temperature is not within a programmed range, or if the fuel temperature varies from ambient temperature (intake air temperature on some models) by a greater degree than expected, a P0180 code will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Some models may require multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) for MIL illumination.\nPhoto of different fuel temperature sensors:\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nFuel temperature is monitored by the PCM to calculate fuel delivery strategy in flex fuel vehicles so a code P0180 should be treated as severe.\nSymptoms of this code may include:\n\n There will likely be no symptoms from the conditions for a P0180 being stored \n Other fuel composition codes may be present \n MIL illumination will eventually occur\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n\n Defective fuel temperature/consumption sensor \"A\"\n A bad ambient temperature sensor \n Faulty intake air temperature sensor \n Open, shorted, or damaged wiring or connectors \n PCM or a PCM programing error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nTo diagnose a code P0180, I would typically gain access to a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), an oscilloscope, an infrared thermometer, and a vehicle information source like All Data DIY. Some scanners have a DVOM and a portable oscilloscope built-in; that would serve you well in this scenario.\nI like to begin any diagnosis with a visual inspection of all related wiring harnesses and connectors. Repair or replace damaged or burnt components as required and retest the system. When multiple failure cycles are required for MIL illumination, I have found that using OBD II readiness mode helpful. When I have completed my repairs, I clear the codes and operate the vehicle normally. If the PCM enters readiness mode, I know that my repairs were successful. If the code is reset, I know that a malfunction still exists.\nThe fuel temperature sensor (integrated into the fuel composition sensor) is typically supplied with a five-volt reference voltage and a ground. The variable resistance sensor completes the circuit. Use the DVOM to test reference voltage and ground at the fuel temp sensor connector. If reference voltage is not present, use the DVOM to test the corresponding circuits at the PCM connector. Repair open circuits as required if there is a reference voltage signal at the PCM connector. Caution: See note at the bottom of the page regarding disconnecting the controllers. If no reference voltage is present at the PCM connector, suspect a faulty PCM or a programming error. PCM replacement or reprogramming will require professional assistance. If there is no fuel temp sensor ground, use your vehicle information source and locate the appropriate ground to make sure that it is secure. \nIf the reference and ground are present at the fuel temperature sensor A connector, connect the test leads of the oscilloscope to the appropriate circuits and observe live data in the form of waveform patterns. Use the infrared thermometer to measure actual fuel temperature and compare it with the temperature reflected by the waveform patterns on the oscilloscope. If the fuel temperature reflected by the fuel temperature sensor fails to coincide with that of the thermometer, suspect that the fuel temperature sensor is defective.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Use the DVOM to test fuel temperature sensor resistance according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations \n Disconnect all related controllers prior to testing circuit resistance with the DVOM \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

It is actually a small computerized device designed to provide the PCM with an accurate fuel composition and fuel temperature reading. \nFuel which passes through the inline sensor is monitored to determine what degree of ethanol, water, and other contaminants is present. The fuel composition sensor calculates fuel composition and fuel temperature and inputs an electrical signal to the PCM that reflects not only what contaminants are present but also to what degree the fuel has been contaminated. The contamination is measured according to the percentage of contaminants to fuel and is received by the PCM as a square waveform of voltage. The waveform pattern varies in frequency depending upon the degree of contaminants present in the fuel; the closer the waveform frequency, the higher the degree of fuel contamination.

    "Meaning": "P0188 Fuel Temperature Sensor B Circuit High Input",
    "Common Causes": "The fuel composition sensor provides the PCM with an accurate fuel composition and fuel temperature analysis. The fuel composition sensor is computerized and is found in-line between the fuel tank and the fuel rail. \nAs fuel passes through the fuel composition sensor, the percentage of ethanol, water, and other contaminants are assessed. Square waveform voltage patterns are input to the PCM according to the level of contamination in the fuel. Shorter waveform frequencies indicate a high percentage of fuel contamination. Waveform frequency could also be illustrated as the vertical posting of the pattern. The amount of ethanol present in the fuel is typically categorized independently of other contaminants. Flex fuel vehicles function normally even if fuel composition levels are as high as eighty-five-percent ethanol.\nFuel temperature is recognized by the PCM as pulse width or the horizontal portion of the waveform. The thicker the pulse width signal, the higher the temperature of the fuel passing through the fuel composition sensor. One and five-milliseconds (hundredths-of-a-second) is the usual pulse width variation used in most vehicles. \nIf fuel temperature appears much higher than ambient temperature, a P0188 code will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. Most OBD II equipped vehicles will require multiple ignition cycles (with a failure) for MIL illumination.\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nDue to the fact that fuel temperature is used to calculate fuel delivery strategy in flex fuel vehicles, this code should be treated as severe. Symptoms of a P0188 code may include:\n\n Possible MIL illumination\nThere may be no obvious symptoms \n Other fuel composition codes may be present\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n\n Faulty intake air temperature sensor\nA bad ambient temperature sensor\nDefective fuel temperature/composition sensor\nOpen, shorted, or damaged wiring or connectors\nPCM or a PCM programing error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nPossibly the most complete tool for diagnosing a code P0188 is a diagnostic scanner with an integrated DVOM and oscilloscope. An infrared thermometer and a vehicle information source (like All Data DIY) can also be very helpful.\nA visual inspection of all related wiring harnesses and connectors is an appropriate beginning to any diagnosis. Damaged, burnt, or corroded wiring and connectors will need to be repaired or replaced. Next, clear the codes and retest the system. Utilize the OBD II readiness mode when multiple failure cycles are required for MIL illumination. Simply complete your repairs and clear the codes, then drive the vehicle normally. If the PCM enters readiness mode, your repairs were effective. By the same token, the malfunction still exists if the code is reset.\nFuel composition sensor operation is normally accomplished with a five-volt reference signal and a ground. The variable resistance fuel composition sensor completes the circuit and provides the PCM with a fluctuating fuel temperature voltage signal. Continue by testing reference voltage and ground at the fuel temp sensor connector using the DVOM. If reference voltage is not present at the fuel temperature sensor connector, use the DVOM to test parallel circuits at the PCM connector. If no reference voltage is discovered at the PCM connector, a faulty PCM or a PCM programming error may be the problem. Consider PCM failure only as a last resort.\nBy using the oscilloscope, you can observe live data in waveform patterns if the reference and ground are both present at the fuel temperature sensor connector. Connect the test leads to the ground and signal circuits and observe the waveform patterns on the display screen. Use the infrared thermometer to obtain actual fuel temperature and compare it with the temperature reflected by the waveform patterns on the oscilloscope. If the fuel temperature reflected by the waveform voltage patterns fails to coincide with that of the thermometer, suspect that the fuel temperature sensor is defective.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n Use the DVOM to test fuel temperature sensor resistance according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations\nNOTE: Disconnect all related controllers prior to testing circuit resistance with the DVOM \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n98 Bmw 323i p0170,p0188Hello everyone.My first time on here so I will try to do this right.Bare with me please.I have a 1998 BMW 323i 6cyl. 5-speed tranny.Im getting a p0170 fuel trim malfunction(bank 1) along with p0188 Fuel tempeture sensor B circuit high input.Right around 2500 RPMs the car stutters a bit.Can anyone he...\u00a0\nNeed more help with a p0188 code?\nIf you still need help regarding the P0188 trouble code, please post \n  your question in our FREE car repair forums.\nWe are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\nShare\n\n\nNOTE: This information is presented for information purposes only. \n  It is not intended as repair advice and we are not responsible for any actions \n  you take on any vehicle.

This usually indicates an open circuit. \nA typical engine oil temperature sensor:\nRelated engine oil temperature sensor trouble codes include:\n\nP0195 Engine Oil Temperature Sensor Malfunction\nP0196 Engine Oil Temperature Sensor Range/Performance\nP0197 Engine Oil Temperature Sensor Low\nP0199 Engine Oil Temperature Sensor Intermittent\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nThe severity of these codes is moderate to severe. In some cases, these codes set along with coolant temperature codes, can indicate an engine overheat condition. It\u2019s a good idea to address this code as soon as possible. \n Symptoms of a P0198 engine code may include: \n\nIlluminated Check Engine Light\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this P0198 code include: \n\nEngine cooling system problems\nWiring problems\nFaulty engine oil temperature sensor\nFaulty PCM\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nBegin by visually inspecting the engine oil temperature sensor and the corresponding wiring. Look for loose connections, damaged wiring, etc.  If damage is found, repair as necessary, clear the code and see if it returns.\nNext, check for technical service bulletins (TSBs) regarding the issue. If nothing is found, you will need to move forward to step by step diagnosis of the system.\nThe following is a generalized procedure, as testing for this code varies between vehicles. To accurately test the system, you'll want to refer to the manufacture\u2019s diagnostic flow chart. \nCheck for proper cooling system operation: Check that the engine reaches and maintains a proper operating temperature. If the engine overheats or does not warm up as designed, there is a problem with the cooling system that should be addressed prior to any further testing. Cooling system DTCs being set along with an engine oil temperature sensor DTC, also indicate a potential problem with the cooling system.\n\n Do some preliminary circuit testing: Use a scan tool to monitor the engine oil temperature sensor data parameter. Disconnect the EOT sensor; the scan tool value should drop to a very low value. Next, connect a jumper wire across the terminals. If the scan tool now displays a very high temperature, the connections are sound and the ECM can recognize the input. This means the problem is most like the sensor and not a circuit or PCM problem.\nTest the sensor: Disconnect the engine oil temperature sensor connector. Next, measure the resistance between the two sensor terminals using a digital multimeter set to ohms. Start the engine and watch the meter value; the values should decrease smoothly as the engine warms up (check the engine temperature gauge on the dash to ensure the engine reaches operating temperature). If engine temperature increases but EOT resistance does not decrease, the sensor is faulty and should be replaced. Note: most manufactures have resistance/temperature charts in their service information to aid in the diagnostic process.\nCheck the circuit:\n\n Check the reference voltage side of the circuit: with the ignition on, use a digital multimeter set to volts to check for a 5-volt reference from the PCM at one of the two engine oil temperature sensor sensor terminals. If no reference signal is present, connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the reference voltage pin on the EOT and the reference voltage pin on the PCM. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.  If everything is good up to this point, you'll want to check that there is 5-volts coming out of the PCM at the reference voltage terminal. If there is not a 5-volt reference from the PCM, the PCM is probably faulty.\nCheck the ground signal side of the circuit: connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the ground terminal on the engine oil temperature sensor and the ground terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity. Finally, check that the PCM has a good ground by attaching one meter lead to the PCM ground terminal and the other to chassis ground. Once again, If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and ground that will need to be located and repaired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nP0198 dodge chargerGood morning I keep receiving a code 0198 on my dodge charger I replaced the oil sensor 2 times and it's still on, what could that be....\u00a02005 F250 5.4l 3v; P0198 oil temp sensorPurchased a 2005 F250 w/ a BAD (5.4l 3V) MOTOR.

  "P0200": {
    "Meaning": "P0200 Fuel Injector Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM supplies the ground circuit to each injector by means of an internal switch called a \"driver\". The PCM monitors each driver circuit for faults. For example, when a fuel injector is commanded \"off\" by the PCM, it expects to see a high voltage on the driver ground circuit. Conversely, when a fuel injector is commanded \"on\" by the PCM, it expects to see the voltage pulled low on the driver circuit\n If it doesn't see this expected condition on the driver circuit, P0200 or P1222 may set. Other injector circuit fault codes may set as well. \nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0200 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nEngine misfire at idle or at highway speed\nEngine may start and stall or not start at all\nCylinder misfire codes may be present\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of an P0200 code include:\n\nOpen or shorted injector\nInjector low internal resistance (basically an injector that works, but is out of specs)\nGrounded driver circuit\nOpen driver circuit\nDriver circuit shorted to voltage\nWiring harness intermittently shorting against underhood components\n\nPossible Solutions\n1. If you have multiple misfire/injector codes, a good first step is to unplug all the fuel injectors and then turn the ignition on, engine off (KOEO). Check for presence of battery voltage (12 Volts) at one wire of each injector connector. If all are missing, check for continuity to ground on the voltage circuit by using a test light connected to positive battery and probe each voltage feed. If it lights up, then there is a short to ground on the voltage feed causing a short. Get a wiring diagram and repair the short on the voltage feed and reestablish proper battery voltage. (Don't forget to check for a blown fuse and replace as necessary). NOTE: It's possible for one injector to short out the whole battery voltage feed to all the injectors. So if you have lost voltage to all the injectors, replace the blown fuse and plug each injector in, one by one. If the fuse blows, the last injector you plugged in is shorted. Replace it and retest. If only one or two battery feeds are missing, then it's more likely to be a shorted battery voltage feed in the individual injector wiring harness. Inspect and repair as necessary.\n2. If you have battery voltage fed to each injector harness, then the next step is to get a noid light to check for injector driver operation. A noid light will insert into the injector harness in place of the fuel injector and flash rapidly when the injector driver operates. Check each fuel injector connector. If the noid light flashes rapidly then suspect the injector. Ohm each fuel injector if you have a resistance specification. If the injector is open or the resistance is higher or lower than the spec, replace the fuel injector. If the injector tests out, the problem is likely an intermittent wiring problem. (Remember that a fuel injector can work properly when cold but go open when hot, or vice versa. So it's best to do these checks when the problem is occurring). Check the wiring harness for any chafing, or the injector connector for loose pins or a broken lock. Repair as necessary and retest. Now, if the noid light doesn't flash, then there's a problem with the driver or the driver circuit. Unplug the PCM connector and ohm the fuel injector driver circuits. Any resistance means there's a problem. Infinite resistance points to an open in the circuit. Find it and repair it, then retest. If you can find no problem with the harness and there is no fuel injector driver operation, then check the PCM powers and grounds. If they are okay, the PCM may be at fault. \n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n99 s-10 how to read voltages on MAP sensor?

    "Meaning": "P0216 Injection Timing Control Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "NOTE: If your vehicle is a Dodge Ram with Cummins engine then be aware that fuel delivery problems frequently cause this code. Prolonged fuel delivery problems can cause injection pump failure!\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0216 DTC may include:\n\nLow power\nCrank, but no start\nHard start\nDisplays an intermittent stumble or miss\nEngine may start and then stall\nEngine may appear to drive fine but surge at idle\n\nCauses\nThe most frequent cause of this code is a bad injection pump due to poor fuel delivery. Fuel delivery problems could be: \n\nA plugged diesel fuel filter\nAn in-tank blockage\nAir in the fuel due to a cracked in-tank fuel ine above the fuel level\nBad transfer (lift) pump\nInjection pump out of time\n\nPossible Solutions\nFirst, simply check if your injection pump timing is adjustable. If so, check the timing and adjust if necessary.\nIf you think that you may have a fuel delivery problem, then check the lift pump operation. On Dodge Ram with the Cummins engine, the lift pump should produce about 45 oz of diesel in 25 seconds of operation. This can be performed by disconnecting the fuel hose from the injection pump and pumping the fuel into an approved container. Bump the engine over but do not start it. Then the lift pump will operate for 25 seconds. If the fuel is aerated, then check/repair fuel line and recheck.\nWith the fuel hose connected the fuel pressure should be 10psi. If the fuel delivery tests fail, replace the diesel fuel filter and recheck.\nIf it still fails then verify there are no restrictions in the fuel tank\n Then replace the lift (transfer) pump. IT SHOULD BE NOTED that if this code surfaced after a routine fuel filter replacement or if you have any of the above symptoms after routine fuel filter replacement, then suspect the fuel transfer pump. This occurs because even a weak transfer pump can still provide enough fuel for the engine to run. But when the fuel system\\'s prime is lost due to fuel filter replacement, it may not restart again without fixing the fuel delivery problem.\nIf you found your injection pump to be bad, the lift pump should be checked for operation to protect the new injection pump. This is because weak or low output from lift pump are common cause of injection pump failure. There are some aftermarket kits that can be purchased to warn the operator when the fuel pressure/volume drops to level that could damage the injection pump.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2002 dodge ram 2500 5.9L p0216 p0602 p1689Have a fuel problem trk surged tapped on raptor pump and ran better so put on brand new pump still had same symptons. truck drove great for a week 18 psi fuel pressure the trk  stated to shut down fuel pressure went to twenty the died. bled system again took forever to get it started idled rough blu...\u00a0'02 Dodge Cummins P0216Intermittant loss of power.

  "P0217": {
    "Meaning": "P0217 Engine Over Temperature",
    "Common Causes": "An overheat condition is usually anything above 240-250 deg. F (will vary according to manufacturer) in the cooling system. The overtemp light is designed to illuminate before engine damage occurs but shutting the engine down as soon as possible should be your first priority.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0217 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nLoss of power\nCoolant expelled from reservoir or radiator\nLow coolant\nAcrid smell of coolant due to leak\nAir conditioner inoperative (In the event of an overheat condition, the PCM (powertrain control module) on some vehicles shuts down the A/C system to reduce load on the engine).\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0217 code include:\n\nLow coolant due to leak in cooling system\nRestriction/debris in the A/C condenser or radiator\nRestriction/debris in the cooling system\nThermostat stuck closed or faulty\nInoperative cooling fan(s)\nCylinder head gasket leaking combustion into cooling system\nOverloaded trailer towing\nFaulty water pump (impeller broken/damaged)\n\nPossible Solutions\nStart by checking the coolant level ON A COLD ENGINE. It's never a good idea to check the coolant on a hot or overheated engine. Also, putting cold water in an overheated, empty cooling system causes thermal shock and isn't a good idea.\nIf you find your cooling system is low on coolant and you have a P0217 stored, inspect the system for leaks and repair as necessary. Then change the thermostat (see note below) and after refilling the cooling system, restart the engine and verify it isn't overheating. Be aware that it's possible for an overheated engine to expel the coolant out of the radiator cap to protect the cooling system from over-pressurization. If you can't locate a leak, this may be the reason.\nFollow the steps below to check the performance of the cooling system. If the coolant level is normal, check the radiator and A/C condenser for any type of restriction that could impede airflow. This step may require removing the radiator and visually inspecting it outside of the vehicle. Check in between the radiator and the condenser for restriction or debris. Make sure all the plastic panels that direct airflow into the radiator are in place. If you have access to a scan tool, check the cooling fans for operation or abnormal noise indicating a bearing failure. Look down into the radiator tank (if possible) and observe the condition. Is there a lot of buildup that may restrict coolant flow? If so, replace the radiator.\nIf you don't notice any apparent problems, and the vehicle continues to overheat, feel the upper radiator hose. Is it hot, indicating that the coolant is flowing freely? If not, the water pump impeller may be damaged or broken causing a no-flow condition. If the water pump appears to be working properly, the thermostat may be faulty. Replace it and re-check. If after the above checks, you still have problems with overheating and coolant being expelled from the system, you may have combustion gasses leaking into the cooling system. This would require a combustion gas leak-test on the cooling system. If you have a P0217 but the vehicle isn't overheating, there may be a faulty coolant temperature sender.\nNote: An overheated engine can effectively ruin the thermostat. So it's always best to replace the thermostat after an overheat condition. If you don't you may successfully repair the original cause of the overheat but still have an overheat condition due to the damaged thermostat.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2011 Peugeot 308 sw codes P02178, P0011, P2192In the beginning the cooling fan was working in high speed with colde engine it works by time not by temperature and after check with scan device we found this faults \nP2178\nP0011\nP2192\nPlease advise me what can I do ?\n\nMany thanks for your help...\u00a0Nissan altima 03 p0420 p1574 now p0217 p0731 alsoCodes P0420 P1574 my car over heated and now I have P0217 P0731 besides the first two....

  "P0219": {
    "Meaning": "P0219 Engine Overspeed Condition",
    "Common Causes": "When a code P0219 is stored, it means that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected that the engine has been operated at a level of revolutions per minute (RPM) which exceeds the maximum threshold.\nThe PCM uses input signals from the crankshaft position sensor (CKP), camshaft position sensor (CMP), and the transmission output speed sensor/s to establish whether (or not) an engine overspeed condition has occurred.\nIn most cases, the overspeed condition will be automatically met with a rev-limiting device when the transmission is in neutral or park. When the PCM detects an overspeed condition, one of several courses of action may be taken. Either the PCM will discontinue fuel injector pulse and/or retard ignition timing to decrease engine RPM until they return to an acceptable level.\nIf the PCM is unable to effectively return the engine RPM to an acceptable level, within a certain period of time, a code P0219 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nWhat is the severity of this DTC?\nSince over-revving the engine may result in catastrophic damage, a stored code P0219 should be addressed with some degree of urgency.\nInstrument cluster showing tachometer in action:\n\nWhat are some of the symptoms of the code?\nSymptoms of a P0219 trouble code may include:\n There will likely be no drivability symptoms associated with a stored code P0219\nThe engine may be allowed to over-rev repeatedly\nKnock sensor activation/knock sensor codes\nClutch slippage (vehicles with manual transmissions)\n\nWhat are some of the common causes of the code?\nCauses for this P0219 transmission code may include:\n Driver error from deliberate or accidental over revving of the engine\nDefective CKP or CMP sensor\nBad transmission input or output speed sensor\nOpen or shorted circuit in the CKP, CMP, or transmission input/output speed sensor system\nFaulty PCM or a PCM programming error\n\nWhat are some P0219 troubleshooting steps?\nI like to have access to a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), an oscilloscope, and a reliable vehicle information source before attempting to diagnose a vehicle with a stored code P0219. If available, a scanner with an integrated DVOM and oscilloscope will work well for this task.\nObviously, you want to ensure that the vehicle has not been (deliberately or inadvertently) operated at RPM levels which are greater than those recommended by the manufacturer. This is especially true when considering vehicles with manual transmissions. In these types of vehicles, you will also want to ensure that the clutch is working effectively before attempting to diagnose this code.\nYou will want to connect the scanner to the diagnostic port of the vehicle and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Writing this information down has proven helpful (to me) more times than I can count. Now, clear the codes and operate the vehicle normally to see if the code is reset.\nIf the codes reset:\n\nUse the DVOM and the oscilloscope to test the CKP, CMP, and transmission speed sensors as recommended in the vehicle information source.

If you aren't comfortable with using a DVOM (Digital Volt Ohm meter) to adjust the new TPS, then it's best to take the vehicle to a shop. If the voltage is not .45 volts (+or- .3 volts or so) with the throttle closed or if the reading is \"stuck\" then unplug the TPS connector. With KOEO check for 5 volts reference voltage present at the connector and a good ground. You can check the signal circuit for continuity by jumping a fused wire between the ground circuit of the TPS connector and the signal circuit. If the TPS reading on the scan tool now reads zero, then replace the TPS. However if that doesn't change the reading to zero, then check for an open or a short on the signal wire and if none is found, suspect a bad PCM. If manipulating the TPS wiring harness causes any change in idle, then suspect bad TPS.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nU1000 reduced engine power - 03 2500 Silverado 6.0 P0220Code = U1000\nDriver Info Center = Reduced Engine Power\nCheck Engine Light = None\n\nA month ago, I started to get the Driver Info Center message stating \"Reduced Engine Power\".

  "P0223": {
    "Meaning": "P0223 Throttle Position Sensor/Switch B Circuit High Input",
    "Common Causes": "Consult a reliable vehicle information source (All Data DIY will work) for particulars for the vehicle in question. This code is only used in vehicles that are equipped with drive by wire (DBW) systems.\nThe PCM controls the DBW system using a throttle actuator motor, one or more pedal position sensors (sometimes referred to as accelerator pedal position sensors), and multiple throttle position sensors. The sensors are provided with a reference voltage (typically 5-volts) and a ground. Most TPS/PPS sensors are of the potentiometer type and they complete the respective circuit. A pivoting fulcrum extension, on the accelerator pedal or the throttle plate shaft, actuates the contacts of the sensor. Sensor resistance changes, as the contacts are moved across the sensor circuit board, causing variations in circuit resistance and signal input voltage to the PCM.\nIf signal input voltage is greater than a programmed limit, for an extended period of time and under a certain set of circumstances, a code P0223 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nSymptoms / Severity\nWhen this code is stored, the PCM will usually enter limp in mode. Engine acceleration will be severely limited (if not disabled) in this mode. Symptoms of a P0223 code may include:\n\n Stuck throttle (at any RPM) \n Limited or no acceleration \n Engine stall when allowed to idle \n Hesitation when accelerating \n Cruise control inoperative\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Open or shorted circuits between the TPS, PPS, and the PCM \n Defective TPS or PPS \n Corroded electrical connectors \n Faulty drive-by-wire actuator motor\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nI would gain access to a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a vehicle information source like All Data (DIY) to diagnose a code P0223.\nI would make the first step of my diagnosis a visual inspection of all system related wiring and connectors. I also like to check the throttle plate for signs of carbon buildup or damage. Excessive carbon buildup, that holds the throttle body open at startup, may cause a code P0223 to be stored. Clean carbon from the throttle body according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and repair or replace defective wiring or components as required, then retest the DBW system.\nNext, I connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored trouble codes. I write them down just in case I need the order in which the codes were stored. I also like to keep any related freeze frame data. These notes may prove helpful if the P0223 is proven intermittent. Now I clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle. If the code is reset, I continue with my diagnosis\nVoltage spikes and inconsistencies, between the TPS, PPS, and the PCM, may be detected using the scanner data stream. Narrow the data stream to display only pertinent data for a faster response. If no spikes and/or inconsistencies are detected, use the DVOM to retrieve live data at each of the sensors, individually. To retrieve live data with the DVOM, connect the test leads to the appropriate signal and ground circuits and observe the DVOM display while operating the DBW. Look for spikes in voltage as the throttle is actuated slowly from the closed position to wide open throttle. Voltage usually ranges from .5-volts at closed throttle to 4.5-volts at wide open throttle. If spikes or other irregularities are detected, suspect that the sensor being tested is defective. An oscilloscope is also a great tool for testing sensor operation. \nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nSome manufacturers require that the throttle body, throttle actuator motor, and all throttle position sensors be replaced together\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2010 Silverado P0122, P0223, P2135, C0242, U2100My truck keeps going into limp mode and says Engine power reduced, and service traction control.

  "P0224": {
    "Meaning": "P0224 Throttle Position Sensor/Switch B Circuit Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "The TPS is typically a potentiometer type sensor that completes a five-volt reference circuit. The TPS is mechanically actuated using an extension of the throttle plate shaft or a specially designed tab on the sensor. As the throttle is opened and closed, contacts in the sensor are dragged across a circuit board, varying sensor resistance. As sensor resistance is changed, TPS circuit voltage fluctuates. The PCM recognizes these fluctuations as varying degrees of throttle plate actuation.\nThe PCM uses input voltage signals from the TPS to calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing. It also uses TPS input data to monitor intake air flow, exhaust oxygen content, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) function, and engine load percentage.\nIf the PCM detects a certain number of intermittent or erratic signals from the TPS, over a set period of time, and under a programmed set of circumstances, a code P0224 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nThe TPS plays an important role in engine drivability, therefore a stored code P0224 should be addressed with some degree of urgency.\nSymptoms of a P0224 code may include:\n\n Hesitation upon acceleration \n Black smoke from engine exhaust (especially on start up) \n Delayed engine startup (particularly on cold start) \n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Stored emissions related codes may accompany a P0224\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Defective or misadjusted TPS \n Open or shorted TPS \"B\" wiring or connectors \n Binding or damaged throttle plate \n Bad PCM or a PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nI typically use a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and an accurate vehicle information source (ALL DATA DIY) to diagnose a code P0224. \nA successful diagnosis usually begins with a visual inspection of all system related wiring and connectors. I also like to test the throttle plate for signs of carbon coking or damage. Repair or replace defective wiring or components as required, then recheck the throttle body and TPS.\nConnect the scanner to the diagnostic connector; retrieve all stored trouble codes and write them down for future reference. I also keep any related freeze frame data. My notes are often helpful if the stored code proves to be intermittent. Next, I would clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle. Continue with the diagnosis if the code is reset. If it is not reset, the condition may need to worsen before a correct diagnosis can be made. Operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters readiness mode or the code is reset.\nProceed by checking for technical service bulletins (TSB) that apply to the particular malfunction (and vehicle) in question by consulting your vehicle information source. If applicable, use the information contained in the appropriate TSB to help with your diagnosis. TSBs can be especially helpful when diagnosing an intermittent condition.\nThe scanner data stream may yield useful information regarding glitches and inconsistencies in the throttle position sensor. If you narrow the scanner data stream to display only pertinent data, you will get a more accurate data response. \nIf no glitches are detected, use the DVOM to test the TPS. Using the DVOM gives you access to live data if the appropriate test leads are connected to the ground and signal circuits. Watch the DVOM display while operating the throttle manually. Look for glitches in voltage as the throttle is actuated slowly from the closed position to wide open throttle. Voltage typically ranges from .5-volts at closed throttle to 4.5-volts at wide open throttle. If glitches or other inconsistencies are detected, suspect that the sensor being tested is defective or misadjusted.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n If the TPS has been replaced and a P0224 continues to be stored, consult the vehicle information source for TPS adjustment specs \n Use the DVOM (with the test leads connected to the ground and signal circuits) to adjust the TPS accurately\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0228": {
    "Meaning": "P0228 Throttle Position Sensor/Switch C Circuit High Input",
    "Common Causes": "Consult a reliable vehicle information source (All Data DIY will work) for particulars for the vehicle in question. This code is only used in vehicles that are equipped with drive by wire (DBW) systems.\nThe PCM controls the DBW system using a throttle actuator motor, one or more pedal position sensors (sometimes referred to as accelerator pedal position sensors), and multiple throttle position sensors. The sensors are provided with a reference voltage (typically 5-volts) and a ground. Most TPS/PPS sensors are of the potentiometer type and they complete the respective circuit. A pivoting fulcrum extension, on the accelerator pedal or the throttle plate shaft, actuates the contacts of the sensor. Sensor resistance changes, as the contacts are moved across the sensor circuit board, causing variations in circuit resistance and signal input voltage to the PCM.\nIf signal input voltage is greater than a programmed limit, for an extended period of time and under a certain set of circumstances, a code P0228 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nSymptoms / Severity\nWhen this code is stored, the PCM will usually enter limp in mode. Engine acceleration will be severely limited (if not disabled) in this mode. Symptoms of a P0228 code may include:\n\n Stuck throttle (at any RPM) \n Limited or no acceleration \n Engine stall when allowed to idle \n Hesitation when accelerating \n Cruise control inoperative\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Open or shorted circuits between the TPS, PPS, and the PCM \n Defective TPS or PPS \n Corroded electrical connectors \n Faulty drive-by-wire actuator motor\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nI would gain access to a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a vehicle information source like All Data (DIY) to diagnose a code P0228.\nI would make the first step of my diagnosis a visual inspection of all system related wiring and connectors. I also like to check the throttle plate for signs of carbon buildup or damage. Excessive carbon buildup, that holds the throttle body open at startup, may cause a code P0228 to be stored. Clean carbon from the throttle body according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and repair or replace defective wiring or components as required, then retest the DBW system.\nNext, I connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored trouble codes. I write them down just in case I need the order in which the codes were stored. I also like to keep any related freeze frame data. These notes may prove helpful if the P0228 is proven intermittent. Now I clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle. If the code is reset, I continue with my diagnosis\nVoltage spikes and inconsistencies, between the TPS, PPS, and the PCM, may be detected using the scanner data stream. Narrow the data stream to display only pertinent data for a faster response. If no spikes and/or inconsistencies are detected, use the DVOM to retrieve live data at each of the sensors, individually. To retrieve live data with the DVOM, connect the test leads to the appropriate signal and ground circuits and observe the DVOM display while operating the DBW. Look for spikes in voltage as the throttle is actuated slowly from the closed position to wide open throttle. Voltage usually ranges from .5-volts at closed throttle to 4.5-volts at wide open throttle. If spikes or other irregularities are detected, suspect that the sensor being tested is defective. An oscilloscope is also a great tool for testing sensor operation. \nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nSome manufacturers require that the throttle body, throttle actuator motor, and all throttle position sensors be replaced together\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2011 GMC Terrain 2.4L-codes P0089 and P0228DIm trying to fix my Terrain after the engine light and stabilitrak lights came on and now reduces engine power upon startup.\n\nI scanned it for codes and it pops up P0089 and P0228D.

  "P0229": {
    "Meaning": "P0229 Throttle Position Sensor/Switch C Circuit Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "The TPS is typically a potentiometer type sensor that completes a five-volt reference circuit. The TPS is mechanically actuated using an extension of the throttle plate shaft or a specially designed tab on the sensor. As the throttle is opened and closed, contacts in the sensor are dragged across a circuit board, varying sensor resistance. As sensor resistance is changed, TPS circuit voltage fluctuates. The PCM recognizes these fluctuations as varying degrees of throttle plate actuation.\nThe PCM uses input voltage signals from the TPS to calculate fuel delivery and ignition timing. It also uses TPS input data to monitor intake air flow, exhaust oxygen content, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) function, and engine load percentage.\nIf the PCM detects a certain number of intermittent or erratic signals from the TPS, over a set period of time, and under a programmed set of circumstances, a code P0229 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nThe TPS plays an important role in engine drivability, therefore a stored code P0229 should be addressed with some degree of urgency.\nSymptoms of a P0229 code may include:\n\n Hesitation upon acceleration \n Black smoke from engine exhaust (especially on start up) \n Delayed engine startup (particularly on cold start) \n Diminished fuel efficiency \n Stored emissions related codes may accompany a P0229\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Defective or misadjusted TPS \n Open or shorted TPS \"C\" wiring or connectors \n Binding or damaged throttle plate \n Bad PCM or a PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nI typically use a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and an accurate vehicle information source (ALL DATA DIY) to diagnose a code P0229. \nA successful diagnosis usually begins with a visual inspection of all system related wiring and connectors. I also like to test the throttle plate for signs of carbon coking or damage. Repair or replace defective wiring or components as required, then recheck the throttle body and TPS.\nConnect the scanner to the diagnostic connector; retrieve all stored trouble codes and write them down for future reference. I also keep any related freeze frame data. My notes are often helpful if the stored code proves to be intermittent. Next, I would clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle. Continue with the diagnosis if the code is reset. If it is not reset, the condition may need to worsen before a correct diagnosis can be made. Operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters readiness mode or the code is reset.\nProceed by checking for technical service bulletins (TSB) that apply to the particular malfunction (and vehicle) in question by consulting your vehicle information source. If applicable, use the information contained in the appropriate TSB to help with your diagnosis. TSBs can be especially helpful when diagnosing an intermittent condition.\nThe scanner data stream may yield useful information regarding glitches and inconsistencies in the throttle position sensor. If you narrow the scanner data stream to display only pertinent data, you will get a more accurate data response. \nIf no glitches are detected, use the DVOM to test the TPS. Using the DVOM gives you access to live data if the appropriate test leads are connected to the ground and signal circuits. Watch the DVOM display while operating the throttle manually. Look for glitches in voltage as the throttle is actuated slowly from the closed position to wide open throttle. Voltage typically ranges from .5-volts at closed throttle to 4.5-volts at wide open throttle. If glitches or other inconsistencies are detected, suspect that the sensor being tested is defective or misadjusted.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n If the TPS has been replaced and a P0229 continues to be stored, consult the vehicle information source for TPS adjustment specs \n Use the DVOM (with the test leads connected to the ground and signal circuits) to adjust the TPS accurately\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0230": {
    "Meaning": "P0230 Fuel Pump Primary Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "For obvious reasons it's better to not have higher amperage current anywhere near the PCM. Higher amperage current creates more heat but also in the event of a failure, can cause a PCM failure. This principal applies to any relay. The higher amperages are kept under the hood, away from sensitive areas\n The relay contains basically two sides. The \"control\" side which is basically a coil and the \"switch\" side which is a set of electrical contacts. The control side (or coil side) is the low amp side. It's fed a switched ignition feed (12 volts with key on)and a ground. The ground circuit is activated by the PCM driver when appropriate. When the PCM fuel pump driver activates the relay coil, the coil acts as an electromagnet that pulls the electrical contacts closed which completes the fuel pump circuit. This closed switch allows voltage to flow on the fuel pump activation circuit, activating the pump. Whenever the key is turned on, the PCM grounds the fuel pump circuit for a few seconds, activating the fuel pump and pressurizing the system. The fuel pump won't be activated again until the PCM sees an RPM signal.\nThe driver in the PCM is monitored for faults. When activated the driver or ground circuit voltage should be low. When deactivated the driver/ground potential voltage should be high or near battery voltage. If the PCM sees a voltage other than what is expected, P0230 may be set.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0230 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nNo start condition\nNo fuel pump operation\nFuel pump runs all the time with ignition on \n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0230 code include:\n\nShort to ground on control circuit\nFuel pump control circuit open\nShort to battery voltage on control circuit\nHarness chafing causing one of above conditions\nBad relay\nBad PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nCommand the fuel pump on and off by using a scan tool or simply turning the ignition key on and off without starting the engine. If the fuel pump activates and deactivates, then start the vehicle and measure the current on the control (ground) circuit for a couple of minutes. It should be less than an amp and stay less than an amp.\nIf it doesn't then replacing the relay is a good idea at this point. If the fuel pump won't activate and deactivate, then remove the relay and visually check for discoloration due to heat or loose terminals. If okay, install a test light between the control circuit ignition feed and ground driver terminals (If you're not sure, don't attempt).\nThe test light should illuminate when the key is on or the fuel pump is commanded on. If it doesn't, then make sure there is voltage on one side of the coil (switched ignition feed). If voltage is present repair the open or short on the control ground circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2003 Malibu fuel pump relay p0230Hey all this is my last resort . \nI have a 2003 Malibu that will only crank with \"New \" relay in it .

    "Meaning": "P0231 Low Voltage Fuel Pump Secondary Circuit",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM monitors this feedback circuit to ensure that there is proper voltage being sent to the fuel pump. As it activates the fuel pump relay, it expects to see battery voltage on the feedback circuit. If it sees voltage that is too low or no voltage at all, it may set P0231. \nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0231 DTC may include:\n\nNo start Start and stall\nMisfire\nInadequate fuel supply \n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0231 code include:\n\nBad FP (fuel pump) relay\nHarness chafing causing open in fuel pump supply circuit\nLoose/damaged connectors\nOpen in feedback circuit\nFuel pump fuse blown due to short to ground\n\nNOTE: If no drivability complaints are present and P0231 code is stored, suspect open in feedback circuit between splice and PCM\nPossible Solutions\nTo diagnose fuel pump circuits there's no replacement for a good wiring diagram. Try to locate one before attempting a complex repair. If the vehicle will start and run and no drivability complaints are present, then suspect an open in the feedback circuit between the PCM and where it splices into the fuel pump supply voltage circuit. Repair as necessary.\nIf the vehicle doesn't start or starts and dies due to low fuel pressure, check the fuel pump fuse. If it's blown check for a short to ground on the fuel pump voltage supply circuit. Do this by removing the FP relay and then check the resistance between the voltage supply circuit at the fuel pump connector and ground. If you have little resistance indicating a short to ground, unplug the fuel pump and check again. If it shows high or infinite resistance after unplugging the fuel pump, replace the shorted fuel pump. If the resistance is still low after unplugging the fuel pump then repair short in the FP voltage supply circuit\n If the resistance check is showing that the fuel pump supply circuit is okay then re-check between the FP fuse and the FP relay. There has to be a short somewhere. Check for wiring harness chafing in certain areas. Repair as necessary. If the fuel pump fuse isn't blown and the vehicle won't start or starts and stalls due to low fuel pressure then remove the fuse and check that voltage is present to the fuse. Then check that voltage is traveling from the fuse to the FP relay by re-installing the FP fuse and checking for battery voltage at the FP relay. If the FP fuse or the FP relay doesn't have voltage supplied to it, the fuel pump will not operate. Find the open in the circuit and repair as necessary. If both the FP fuse and the FP relay have sufficient voltage, remove the FP relay and install a fused jumper wire to complete the FP voltage supply circuit (Usually you do this by jumping terminals 30 & 87 in most relays-check a wiring diagram to be sure). If the fuel pump runs, replace the faulty FP relay and recheck. If the fuel pump doesn't run check for voltage present (with jumper connected or by cycling the ignition key with FP relay installed) at the fuel pump connector at the fuel tank. If voltage is present verify that the ground circuit is intact. If both are okay, replace the fuel pump. If voltage isn't present at the fuel pump with fused jumper wire installed, repair open in fuel pump voltage supply circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2009 chevy 1500 5.3 flex fuel code p0231 + p0693hello..i'll make a long story short..2009 chevy 1500 5.3 flex fuel.never had a problem with truck at all.  the other day I got a code of p0231 + p0693  ..I replaced the battery ,and no change..now heres the kicker .I looked in the fuse compartment under hood to ck the fuel pump fuse and relay and th...\u00a02003 F250 Xlt v10 stalling issue and B1362 P1000 and P02312003 F250 XLT 6.8 v10 taken to 4 mechanics including Ford dealer and Knowone can figure out what's wrong with my truck.

  "P0234": {
    "Meaning": "P0234 Turbocharger / Supercharger \"A\" Overboost Condition Code",
    "Common Causes": "Normally, an engine relies on the vacuum produced by the downward movement of the piston to draw the air and fuel charge into the engine. A supercharger or turbocharger is an air compressor used to increase the air and fuel charge entering the engine. This is known as \"forced induction\" which allows a much smaller fuel-efficient engine to create the power normally available with a much larger engine.\nThe mechanical apparatus used in forced induction is divided into three categories, positive displacement (roots style), centrifugal and turbo. The roots style and centrifugal chargers are belt driven while the turbo relies on pressure from the exhaust to operate.\nA roots or positive displacement supercharger is positioned on the top of the intake. A centrifugal looks much like a rotary air conditioning compressor and is located on the driver's side front of the engine. Turbochargers are located in line with the exhaust system.\nAs boost pressure rises, the stress on the engine increases as well. Your engine has recommended boost pressure limits to preclude the possibility of engine component failure. Code P0234 is set when these limits are breached and should be corrected as soon as possible to prevent engine or transmission damage.\nTurbo chargers rely on exhaust pressure to spin the turbine blades fast enough to produce air pressure greater than atmospheric. However they have an inherent lag where the exhaust pressure is insufficient to spin the turbo fast enough to create pressure. Depending on the type of unit used, the turbo needs 1700 to 2500 engine rpm before it begins to \"spool up.\"\nTurbos spin around 250,000 rpm in full boost. Boost pressure increases with engine rpm. To regulate the boost pressure and prevent overboost, a wastegate valve is installed. Most modern turbos have an internal wastegate and external actuator. There is a rod from the actuator to the wastegate on the turbo. Intake manifold air pressure passes to the top of the wastegate. As boost pressure increases it begins to exert force on the spring in the actuator that holds the wastegate valve closed. The higher the pressure rises, the more it overpowers the spring, resulting in the wastegate opening and directing exhaust gas away from the turbo blades and preventing further increase in boost.\nRegulation of the pressure applied to the wastegate regulates the boost levels at specific rpm. To accomplish this, the computer uses barometric or MAP sensors, engine and transmission temperature sensors, knock sensors and intake pressure sensors to determine the amount of wastegate opening necessary to deliver the best boost levels.\nTo regulate boost levels, the computer uses either a solenoid, stepper motor or pulse modulator. By regulating the pressure to the wastegate actuator, varying degrees of boost are possible.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0234 code will depend on the cause of the overboost condition:\n\nThe service engine soon or check engine light will illuminate.\nYou will experience a loss of power.\nThe engine may show signs of overheating.\nThe transmission may show signs of overheating and harsh shifting.\nAdditional codes associated with the condition set by P0234 may be present to help identify the cause. Codes are available for all electrical components utilized by the engine management computer for the control of boost levels.\nThe engine may display signs of pre-ignition in the form of knocking.\nThe engine may display ignition misfiring.\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this DTC include:\n\nIn lieu of further trouble codes associated with the overboost condition it would be safe to say the problem is mechanical. The operation of the wastegate is the most probable.\nThe wastegate is either stuck closed causing the turbo to spin higher than normal, thus causing the overboost.\nThe rod from the wastegate actuator to the wastegate on the turbo is bent.\nA hose came off the wastegate or boost controller.\nA supply house to the boost controller or from the controller to the wastegate is clogged.\nDodge trucks with a Cummins diesel have a peculiar problem. They run fine but the check engine light comes on and sets code P0234 at an idle, yet the light goes out several minutes later at cruise speeds. The digital boost control gauge is connected into the MAP sensor which has an intermittent fault at idle yet does not set a code. Replacement of the MAP sensor corrects this.\n\nDiagnostic Steps & Possible Solutions\nInspect the wastegate actuator rod to the turbo. Repair it if its bent.\nInspect the hoses including the one from the boost controller to the wastegate actuator and the feed lines to the boost controller. Look for cracks or disconnected hoses. Pull the hose ends and look for plugged lines.\nConnect a vacuum pump to the wastegate controller. Pump it slowly while watching the actuator rod. Make a note of the inches of mercury necessary to actuate the rod, or whether the rod moves at all. Consult a service manual for vacuum necessary to actuate the wastegate. If it is out of specification, replace the actuator.\nIf the rod fails to move or the wastegate actuator fails to hold vacuum, replace the actuator. If it holds a vacuum yet fails to move the rod, the internal wastegate in the turbo is stuck closed. Remove the turbo and have the wastegate repaired.\nStart the engine and disconnect the supply hose to the boost controller. Inspect it for obstructions and boost pressure. Install the hose and disconnect the hose on the opposite side of the boost controller. There must be boost pressure present - if not replace the boost controller.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n02' Chevrolet Duramax Diesel DTC's!!!

  "P0235": {
    "Meaning": "P0235 Turbocharger Boost Sensor A Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "Code P0235 is a generic code inasmuch as it refers to a problem in the turbocharger boost sensor A circuit. Although generic in nature, never assume it is identical for all vehicles. \nOBD codes do not necessarily point to a specific item, but rather to an area for the technician to search for possible causes for a problem within this circuit, which could include multiple possibilities. \nAll vehicles with code P0235 have a singular point in common. It refers to an unacceptable variance between the ECM (electronic control module) programmed percentage of turbo boost at a specific RPM and the sensor's signal value. These two values must coincide within close limits. \nHow Turbocharging (forced induction) Increases Performance \nTurbochargers force a great deal more air into the engine than the engine is capable of under normally aspirated conditions. The higher the volume of air forced into the cylinders in addition to the increased fuel equals greater power. \nTypically a turbocharger can increase horsepower by 35 to 50 percent in an engine designed specifically for turbocharging. A conventional engine's components will not withstand the stress placed on it by forced induction. \nTurbochargers offer high horsepower gains with little or no adverse effect on fuel economy. They use exhaust velocity to propel the turbocharger, so in essence, it is free horsepower. That is the upside. The downside is that they take a beating and tend to fail at unpredictable times for a host of reasons. When an indication that a problem with the turbocharger has occurred, address it as soon as possible. A turbocharged engine greatly exaggerates engine problems due to the compressed air mass. \nNever tighten the wastegate or attempt to install any modification to a stock turbocharged engine in an effort to increase boost pressures. The fuel and timing curve on most engines will not adapt to higher than normal boost pressures and engine damage will occur. \nNote: This DTC is basically identical to P0239 which refers to the \"B\" turbocharger.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0235 diagnostic trouble code may include:\n\nThe code P0235 will be set which simply means that a problem exists somewhere within this circuit preventing proper boost control. Additional codes in progression may be set regarding this malfunction, each of which pertains to a section of the circuit.\nThe engine may lack acceleration.\nThe boost pressure gauge will indicate less than 9 pounds of boost or over 14 pounds of boost. Both are out of range. \nUnusual whining noises or rattling from the turbocharger or piping. \nEngine knock sensor code may appear indicating detonation is occurring due to high cylinder head temperatures. \nEngine may exhibit an overall lack of power. \nSmoke from the exhaust. \nFouled spark plugs \nEngine temperature unusually high at cruise speeds. \nHissing noises at the wastegate \n\nCauses\nTurbos typically spin at an incredible 100,000 to 150,000 RPM. They are not the least tolerant to out of balance conditions or lack of clean oil to the bearing. Potential causes for this DTC include:\nVacuum leak at the intake manifold \nDirty air cleaner\nDefective wastegate- either stuck open, closed or leaking\nInsufficient oil supply to main shaft bearing-obstruction in the oil feed or return line.\nBearing failure causing low spin-up due to drag.\nWobble in the bearing causing the turbine blades to strike the turbo housing.\nNicked, bent or missing turbine blades causing an out-of-balance situation.\nOil seal leak on the compressor side of the turbo as seen by oil in the turbo and fouled plugs.\nExcessive end play in the turbo shaft\nDefective intercooler\nLoose connections at intake pipe to throttle body\nCracks in the turbo housing\nLoose exhaust manifold to turbo bolts.\nPoor electrical connection at Turbo boost sensor.\nShort or open in the sensor harness between the sensor and ECM.\nDefective sensor or ECM 5 volt reference driver. \n\nDiagnostic Steps & Possible Solutions\nIt's been my experience that the flow of diagnosis begins with the most common turbo problems and working systematically down the line too the least likely. Simple tools are needed such as a vacuum gauge and dial indicator.\n\nConfirm that the engine is running properly with no misfiring plugs and no codes relating to a failed knock sensor.\nOn a cold engine, inspect the hose clamps at the turbo outlet, intercooler and throttle body for tightness.\nAttempt to rock the turbo on the exhaust flange to see if it is tight.\nInspect the intake manifold for leaks of any kind including vacuum hoses.\nRemove the actuating arm from the wastegate. Operate the valve manually while looking for a sticking valve causing a drop in boost.\nLocate a non-ported vacuum in the intake manifold and install a vacuum gauge. Start the engine. At an idle the engine must have between 16 to 22-inches of vacuum. If it has less than 16 the catalytic converter is bad and will not allow boost to build.\nRev the engine quickly to 5000 RPM and release the throttle while watching the vacuum gauge as it displays boost pressure. If boost pressure rises above 19-pounds of boost you have a bad wastegate. If boost fails to rise between 14 to 19-pounds of boost a problem exists with the turbo itself.\nShut the engine down and allow it to cool. Remove the turbo outlet hose and look inside the turbo to see if the blades are striking the sides of the housing. Look for bent or missing blades or oil in the turbo. Spin the blades by hand and look for grinding or resistance indicating a faulty turbo.\nInspect the oil lines from the engine block to the center turbo bearing and the return line from the bearing to the oil pan for leaks.\nInstall the dial indicator on the outlet turbine nose and move the turbo shaft in and out. If there is over 0.003 of endplay the center bearing is faulty.\nIf the turbo passes these tests it is good. Use the service manual to test the boost sensor and harness using a volt/ohmmeter. Locate the 5 volt reference from the ECM to the sensor and confirm voltage. No voltage present is an open or short in the harness or bad ECM.\nLocate proper reference signal from the boost sensor to the ECM and confirm a varying voltage as the RPM climbs. No voltage climb indicates a bad sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nAudi A6 Avant (2006) - P3348 & P0235Hi all,\n\nPlease can somebody help! \n\nI have an Audi A6 Avant, 2006, which intermittently goes into limp mode (some times it drives normally, albeit with quite low mpg - and other times it has absolutely no power). \n\nIt is showing various (seemingly minor) electrical problems with the radio/voice mod...\u00a02001 Mercedes 230 SLK code P0235Replaced map sensor and engine lite stays on its a 2001mercedesbenz 230slk...\u00a01998 Honda Passport C0252 C0246 C0237 P0300 P0706 P0235I have a 98 Honda Passport, 3.2 V-6 w/auto 2wd..

    "Meaning": "P0239 Turbocharger Boost Sensor B Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "OBD codes do not necessarily point to a specific item, but rather to an area for the technician to search for possible causes for a problem within this circuit, which could include multiple possibilities. \nAll vehicles with code P0239 have a singular point in common. It refers to an unacceptable variance between the ECM (electronic control module) programmed percentage of turbo boost at a specific RPM and the sensor's signal value. These two values must coincide within close limits. \nHow Turbocharging (forced induction) Increases Performance \nTurbochargers force a great deal more air into the engine than the engine is capable of under normally aspirated conditions. The higher the volume of air forced into the cylinders in addition to the increased fuel equals greater power. \nTypically a turbocharger can increase horsepower by 35 to 50 percent in an engine designed specifically for turbocharging. A conventional engine's components will not withstand the stress placed on it by forced induction. \nTurbochargers offer high horsepower gains with little or no adverse effect on fuel economy. They use exhaust velocity to propel the turbocharger, so in essence, it is free horsepower. That is the upside. The downside is that they take a beating and tend to fail at unpredictable times for a host of reasons. When an indication that a problem with the turbocharger has occurred, address it as soon as possible. A turbocharged engine greatly exaggerates engine problems due to the compressed air mass. \nNever tighten the wastegate or attempt to install any modification to a stock turbocharged engine in an effort to increase boost pressures. The fuel and timing curve on most engines will not adapt to higher than normal boost pressures and engine damage will occur. \nNote: This DTC is basically identical to P0235 which refers to the \"A\" turbocharger.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0239 diagnostic trouble code may include:\n\nThe code P0239 will be set which simply means that a problem exists somewhere within this circuit preventing proper boost control. Additional codes in progression may be set regarding this malfunction, each of which pertains to a section of the circuit.\nThe engine may lack acceleration.\nThe boost pressure gauge will indicate less than 9 pounds of boost or over 14 pounds of boost. Both are out of range. \nUnusual whining noises or rattling from the turbocharger or piping. \nEngine knock sensor code may appear indicating detonation is occurring due to high cylinder head temperatures. \nEngine may exhibit an overall lack of power. \nSmoke from the exhaust. \nFouled spark plugs \nEngine temperature unusually high at cruise speeds. \nHissing noises at the wastegate \n\nCauses\nTurbos typically spin at an incredible 100,000 to 150,000 RPM. They are not the least tolerant to out of balance conditions or lack of clean oil to the bearing. Potential causes for this DTC include:\nVacuum leak at the intake manifold \nDirty air cleaner\nDefective wastegate- either stuck open, closed or leaking\nInsufficient oil supply to main shaft bearing-obstruction in the oil feed or return line.\nBearing failure causing low spin-up due to drag.\nWobble in the bearing causing the turbine blades to strike the turbo housing.\nNicked, bent or missing turbine blades causing an out-of-balance situation.\nOil seal leak on the compressor side of the turbo as seen by oil in the turbo and fouled plugs.\nExcessive end play in the turbo shaft\nDefective intercooler\nLoose connections at intake pipe to throttle body\nCracks in the turbo housing\nLoose exhaust manifold to turbo bolts.\nPoor electrical connection at Turbo boost sensor.\nShort or open in the sensor harness between the sensor and ECM.\nDefective sensor or ECM 5 volt reference driver. \n\nDiagnostic Steps & Possible Solutions\nIt's been my experience that the flow of diagnosis begins with the most common turbo problems and working systematically down the line too the least likely. Simple tools are needed such as a vacuum gauge and dial indicator.\n\nConfirm that the engine is running properly with no misfiring plugs and no codes relating to a failed knock sensor.\nOn a cold engine, inspect the hose clamps at the turbo outlet, intercooler and throttle body for tightness.\nAttempt to rock the turbo on the exhaust flange to see if it is tight.\nInspect the intake manifold for leaks of any kind including vacuum hoses.\nRemove the actuating arm from the wastegate. Operate the valve manually while looking for a sticking valve causing a drop in boost.\nLocate a non-ported vacuum in the intake manifold and install a vacuum gauge. Start the engine. At an idle the engine must have between 16 to 22-inches of vacuum. If it has less than 16 the catalytic converter is bad and will not allow boost to build.\nRev the engine quickly to 5000 RPM and release the throttle while watching the vacuum gauge as it displays boost pressure. If boost pressure rises above 19-pounds of boost you have a bad wastegate. If boost fails to rise between 14 to 19-pounds of boost a problem exists with the turbo itself.\nShut the engine down and allow it to cool. Remove the turbo outlet hose and look inside the turbo to see if the blades are striking the sides of the housing. Look for bent or missing blades or oil in the turbo. Spin the blades by hand and look for grinding or resistance indicating a faulty turbo.\nInspect the oil lines from the engine block to the center turbo bearing and the return line from the bearing to the oil pan for leaks.\nInstall the dial indicator on the outlet turbine nose and move the turbo shaft in and out. If there is over 0.003 of endplay the center bearing is faulty.\nIf the turbo passes these tests it is good. Use the service manual to test the boost sensor and harness using a volt/ohmmeter. Locate the 5 volt reference from the ECM to the sensor and confirm voltage. No voltage present is an open or short in the harness or bad ECM.\nLocate proper reference signal from the boost sensor to the ECM and confirm a varying voltage as the RPM climbs. No voltage climb indicates a bad sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

    "Meaning": "P0260 Injection Pump Fuel Metering Control B Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "The Injection Pump Metering Control Circuit \"B\" is usually found mounted inside / on the side of the injection pump bolted to the engine. The Injection Pump Metering Control Circuit \"B\" is usually made up of a Fuel Rack Position (FRP) Sensor and a Fuel Quantity Actuator. \nThe FRP sensor converts the amount of diesel fuel being delivered by the Fuel Quantity Actuator to the injectors into an electrical signal for the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). \nThe PCM receives this voltage signal to determine how much fuel it will put into the engine based upon engine operating conditions. This code is set if this input does not match normal engine operating conditions stored in the PCM\u2019s memory, even for a second, as this diagnostic trouble code demonstrates. It also looks at the voltage signal from the FRP sensor to determine if it is correct at initial Key On.\nThe code P0260 Injection Pump Fuel Metering Control B Intermittent (Cam/Rotor/Injector) could have been set because of mechanical (typically EVAP system mechanical issues) or electrical (FRP sensor circuit) issues. These cannot be overlooked in the troubleshooting stage, especially when dealing with an intermittent problem. Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual to determine which is the \"B\" part of the circuit for your particular application.\nTroubleshooting steps may vary depending upon manufacturer, type of FRP sensor and wire colors.\nWhat is the severity of this DTC?\nSeverity depends upon the failure. If a mechanical failure; severe. If an electrical failure, not as severe, as the PCM can compensate adequately for it.\nWhat are some of the symptoms of the code?\nSymptoms of a P0260 trouble code may include:\n\nMalfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination\nDecrease in fuel economy\n\nWhat are some of the common causes of the code?\nCauses for this P0260 code may include:\n\nOpen in the signal circuit to the FRP sensor - possible\nShort to voltage in the signal circuit to the FRP sensor - possible\nShort to ground in the signal circuit to the FRP sensor - possible\nOpen in power or ground at FRP sensor - possible\nFailed FRP Sensor - likely\nFailed PCM - unlikely \n\nWhat are some P0260 troubleshooting steps?\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nNext, locate the FRP sensor on your vehicle. This sensor is usually found usually found mounted inside / on the side of the injection pump bolted to the engine. Once located, visually inspect the connector and wiring. Look for scraping, rubbing, bare wires, burn spots or melted plastic. Pull the connector apart and carefully inspect the terminals (the metal parts) inside the connector. See if they look burned or have a green tint indicating corrosion. Use electrical contact cleaner and a plastic bristle brush if cleaning of the terminals is needed. Let dry and apply electrical grease where the terminals contact. \nIf you have a scan tool, clear the diagnostic trouble codes from memory, and see if P0260 code returns. If it does not, then the connections were most likely your problem.\nIf the P0260 code does return, we will need to test the FRP sensor and its associated circuits. With the Key Off, disconnect the electrical connector at the FRP sensor. Connect a Digital Voltmeter black lead to the ground terminal at the FRP sensor wiring harness connector. Connect the red lead of the Digital Voltmeter to the power terminal at the FRP sensor wiring harness connector. Turn Key On Engine Off. Check manufacturer\u2019s specifications; voltmeter should read either 12 volts or 5 volts. If not, repair the power or ground wire, or replace the PCM. \nIf the prior test passed, we will need to test the signal wire. With the connector still disconnected, move the red lead of the voltmeter from the power wire terminal to the signal wire terminal. The voltmeter should now read 5 volts. If not, repair the signal wire, or replace the PCM. \nIf all prior tests have passed and you continue to get a P0260, this would most likely indicate a failed FRP sensor / Fuel Quantity Actuator, although a failed PCM could not be ruled out until the FRP sensor / Fuel Quantity Actuator had been replaced. If unsure, seek assistance from a trained automotive diagnostician. PCMs must be programmed, or calibrated to the vehicle to be installed correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

    "Meaning": "P0261 Cylinder 1 Injector Circuit Low",
    "Common Causes": "This code implies that the powertrain control module (PCM) has experienced a low voltage situation involving the fuel injector for the #1 cylinder in the firing order. \nIn short, this fuel injector is malfunctioning for one of a variety of reasons. It is important to diagnose and repair this type of problem as soon as possible. \nWhen a fuel injector malfunctions, it causes ripples down the line, meaning the engine's operating parameters change due to the mixed signals at the PCM.\nIf the fuel injector spray pattern is reduced, a lean mixture will result. The ripple begins. The oxygen sensor signals a lean mixture to the PCM. In response, it richens the fuel mixture to all cylinders. Fuel economy plummets. \nThe cylinder with the faulty injector causes a lean mixture that in turn causes a higher cylinder head temperature resulting in detonation. The knock sensor senses the detonation, signals the PCM which responds by retarding the timing. Now the engine is running rough and lacks power.\nThis is not the end of the ripple effect, but it reflects the general idea. \nCross-section diagram of a typical automotive fuel injector (provided by WikipedianProlific):\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0261 code may include:\n\nThe check engine light will illuminate and code P0261 will set\nThe engine will run rougher than normal\nA lack of power\nA big drop in fuel economy will result \n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this DTC include:\n\nDirty fuel injector supplying the number one cylinder\nFaulty fuel injector\nPlugged fuel injector\nOpen or short in the fuel injector harness\nLoose or corroded fuel injector connector \n\nDiagnosis / Repair\nGenerally, this type of problem is either a loose or corroded electrical connector on the injector, a fouled injector (dirty or plugged) or a bad injector needing replacement.\nIn over 45 years I have found that loose or corroded connectors were the cause of the electrical fault the majority of the time. I have found but a few cases where low voltage wiring became shorted or open (when left undisturbed).\nThe majority of electrical problems were alternator related, starter solenoid wiring, oxygen sensor wiring due to the close proximity to the exhaust and battery related. The majority of electrical work was correcting customer-installed items such as high-power stereos and other parts or equipment installed incorrectly. \nThe fuel injectors get their power from the fuel pump relay. The PCM actuates the relay as the key is turned on. This means, as long as the key is on, the injectors have power. \nThe PCM activates the injector by supplying the ground at the necessary time and for the proper duration.\n\n Check the connector on the fuel injector. It is a plastic connector secured to the injector with a wire clip around the connector. Pull on the connector to see if it comes off easily. Remove the wire clip and pull the connector off the injector.\nInspect the harness connector for corrosion or pushed out pins. Make sure the two blades are not bent in the injector itself. Correct any defect and apply dielectric grease and install the electrical connector.\nStart the engine and listen to the injector to ensure it is working. Use a long screwdriver to the injector and the handle to your ear and you can hear it clearly. If it isn't making a highly audible 'clicking' noise, it either has no electrical power to it or it has failed. \n If it was not clicking, pull the connector off the injector and check for power with a voltmeter. No power means the wiring to the fuel pump relay is at fault or has a loose connection. If it has power, probe both terminals on the harness connector and if the PCM injector driver is operating, the voltmeter will indicate rapid pulses. If pulses are seen, replace the injector. \nIf the injector was operating, then it is either plugged or dirty. Attempt to clean it first. The kit to flush the injectors is inexpensive and will benefit the remaining injectors, possibly preventing a recurrence. If the flushing fails to solve the problem, the injector needs to be replaced. \n\nPurchase online or from an auto parts store  a \"direct\" injector flushing kit. It will consist of a bottle of high-pressure injector cleaner and a hose with an end for the injector cleaner bottle to thread onto. \n\nPull the fuse to the fuel pump. \nStart the vehicle and let it run until it dies from lack of fuel. \nRemove and plug the fuel return line attached to the fuel pressure regulator. This is to prevent the cleaner from returning to the fuel tank. \nRemove the schrader valve in the fuel rail test port. Install the flush kit fuel line to this test port. Thread the high-pressure fuel injection cleaner bottle on the flush kit fuel line. \nStart the engine and allow it to run until it runs out of fuel. It will be running on the cleaner bottle alone. \nWhen the engine quits, turn the key off and remove the flush kit line and replace the schrader valve. Install the fuel pump fuse. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nCodes on my 2005 f350 p0261,p0270, p0401I just recently got a 05 f350 with a 6.0.

  "P0262": {
    "Meaning": "P0262 Cylinder 1 Injector Circuit High",
    "Common Causes": "The cylinder #1 injector is operating poorly or not at all due to a problem within the circuit. It may be noted that although this code is common to all vehicles, the prognosis may vary between manufacturers. \nFor example, they may have been experiencing problems with a batch of fuel injectors, or some other defective item within the circuit limited to their particular vehicles.\nThis type of problem is better addressed as soon as possible to prevent damage to other internal components. A bad fuel injector will effect the spark plug, cause detonation, effects the oxygen sensor and catalytic converter, and several other components as well. \nGo online and access the technical service bulletins (TSBs) for your specific vehicle. Look for any TSBs relating to P0262 and their suggested repair procedure. \nCross-section diagram of a typical automotive fuel injector (provided by WikipedianProlific):\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0262 code may include:\n\nThe malfunction indicator light will illuminate and code P0262 will set\nThe engine will run rough at idle\nThe fuel economy will suffer\nThere will be a lack of power indicated by poor acceleration\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this DTC include:\n\nFaulty electrical harness from the PCM to the injector\nFaulty electrical connector on the fuel injector\nInternally shorted fuel injector causing a high-voltage draw\nPlugged or dirty fuel injector\n\nDiagnosis and Repair Procedure\nIt's been my experience over the years, that the problem is typically a corroded or loose fuel injector connector, or a faulty fuel injector. \nA loose connector causes excessive resistance thereby increasing the voltage necessary for operation. The wiring harness to the powertrain control module (PCM) is not easily accessible, and left undisturbed is seldom faulty. \nThe fuel injector, on the other hand, is susceptible to a variety of problems. The number one problem is fuel with anhydrous ethanol content. This fuel additive reduces the oil base fuel consumption. \nThe water vapor produced with E10 anhydrous ethanol has an adverse effect on the fuel injectors. They rely on fuel for lubrication. Water vapor reduces the friction reducing attributes of gasoline and causes premature wear in the injector. \nSmall engine manufacturers do not endorse the use of ethanol based fuels as they significantly reduce the service life of a small engine. \n\n Inspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Look for bent or pushed out pins. Install some dielectric grease and push the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Make sure it is a tight fit and the metal spring retaining clip is in place\n Start the engine. Place a long screwdriver handle to your ear and the tip on the fuel injector. A clicking sound indicates a working injector. No sound is the opposite\nDisconnect the fuel injector. With an ohmmeter, check the resistance between the two male terminal blades. A good injector will have 0.5 to 2.0 ohms. More or less ohms indicates an injector with an internal short. \nIf the resistance is correct and the injector could be heard operating, the next step is to attempt to clean the injector. If cleaning fails to restore the injector to normal operating parameters, the only alternative is to replace the injector. \nPurchase a 'direct injection cleaner kit consisting of a can of cleaner and a injection hose. Pull the fuel pump fuse and start the engine. Allow it to run until it stalls. \nRemove the schrader valve from the fuel pressure test port on the fuel rail. Install the hose on the test port. \nPinch off the fuel return line directly behind the fuel pressure regulator using a needle nose vise grips. \nOpen the bottle of cleaner to build pressure in the fuel rail. \nStart the engine and allow it to run on the bottle of fuel injection cleaner until it stalls. \nTurn off the key and remove the cleaner hose from the test port. Install the schrader valve, remove the vise grips from the return line and install the fuel pump fuse. \nUse a common code scanner to erase the trouble codes. Start the engine.

Look for related TSBs and the factory recommended repair procedure. \n The powertrain control module (PCM) monitors the power output from each cylinder by comparing the acceleration or increase in speed of the crankshaft during the power stroke of each cylinder. \nWhen one or more cylinders are contributing less power than the rest of the cylinders, the fault code P0263 is set.\nWhile the PCM performs this test to determine if a fuel injector is working properly, an auto technician can perform a similar test to locate internal engine problems. By pulling one spark plug at a time while the engine is running, he notes the RPM drop on each cylinder.\nAll the cylinders must be within 5-percent of each other. Any cylinder showing a lesser drop in RPM is in need of repair. Both tests are similar in that they both compare crankshaft RPM.\nThis is a problem that must be addressed at your earliest convenience to prevent any possible damage from occurring.\nCross-section diagram of a typical automotive fuel injector (provided by WikipedianProlific):\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0263 code may include:\n\nCheck engine light on and code P0263 set\nReduced power and acceleration\nRough idle\n Drop in fuel economy\n\nCauses\nIt's been my experience that this code refers to less power being produced in the number one cylinder. An electrical problem would set a code for either a high or low voltage situation for this injector.\nA lack of fuel to the number one cylinder is the most likely cause. The injector may have failed altogether or it is dribbling a small amount of fuel rather than the normal conical spray. This would be due to dirt or contamination of the inlet filter on the injector.\n\nPossible defective electrical connector on the fuel injector due to corrosion of the terminals or pushed out pins\nDirty or clogged fuel injector\nFuel injector failure\n\nDiagnostic & Repair Procedure\n\nInspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector.

The wiring harness to the powertrain control module (PCM) is not easily accessible, and left undisturbed is seldom faulty. \nThe fuel injector, on the other hand, is susceptible to a variety of problems. The number one problem is fuel with anhydrous ethanol content. This fuel additive reduces the oil base fuel consumption. \nThe water vapor produced with E10 anhydrous ethanol has an adverse effect on the fuel injectors. They rely on fuel for lubrication. Water vapor reduces the friction reducing attributes of gasoline and causes premature wear in the injector. \nSmall engine manufacturers do not endorse the use of ethanol based fuels as they significantly reduce the service life of a small engine. \n\n Inspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Look for bent or pushed out pins. Install some dielectric grease and push the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Make sure it is a tight fit and the metal spring retaining clip is in place\n Start the engine. Place a long screwdriver handle to your ear and the tip on the fuel injector. A clicking sound indicates a working injector. No sound is the opposite\nDisconnect the fuel injector. With an ohmmeter, check the resistance between the two male terminal blades. A good injector will have 0.5 to 2.0 ohms. More or less ohms indicates an injector with an internal short. \nIf the resistance is correct and the injector could be heard operating, the next step is to attempt to clean the injector. If cleaning fails to restore the injector to normal operating parameters, the only alternative is to replace the injector. \nPurchase a 'direct injection cleaner kit consisting of a can of cleaner and a injection hose. Pull the fuel pump fuse and start the engine. Allow it to run until it stalls. \nRemove the schrader valve from the fuel pressure test port on the fuel rail. Install the hose on the test port. \nPinch off the fuel return line directly behind the fuel pressure regulator using a needle nose vise grips. \nOpen the bottle of cleaner to build pressure in the fuel rail. \nStart the engine and allow it to run on the bottle of fuel injection cleaner until it stalls. \nTurn off the key and remove the cleaner hose from the test port. Install the schrader valve, remove the vise grips from the return line and install the fuel pump fuse. \nUse a common code scanner to erase the trouble codes. Start the engine.

    "Common Causes": "This is also a generic code, meaning it is common to all manufacturers. The reference is the same, however, the manufacturer of a specific model may have experienced a defective part or error in installation.\nAlways access the technical service bulletins (TSBs) online for your specific year and make vehicle. Look for related TSBs and the factory recommended repair procedure. \n The powertrain control module (PCM) monitors the power output from each cylinder by comparing the acceleration or increase in speed of the crankshaft during the power stroke of each cylinder. \nWhen one or more cylinders are contributing less power than the rest of the cylinders, the fault code P0266 is set.\nWhile the PCM performs this test to determine if a fuel injector is working properly, an auto technician can perform a similar test to locate internal engine problems. By pulling one spark plug at a time while the engine is running, he notes the RPM drop on each cylinder.\nAll the cylinders must be within 5-percent of each other. Any cylinder showing a lesser drop in RPM is in need of repair.

An electrical problem would set a code for either a high or low voltage situation for this injector.\nA lack of fuel to the number two cylinder is the most likely cause. The injector may have failed altogether or it is dribbling a small amount of fuel rather than the normal conical spray. This would be due to dirt or contamination of the inlet filter on the injector.\n\nPossible defective electrical connector on the fuel injector due to corrosion of the terminals or pushed out pins\nDirty or clogged fuel injector\nFuel injector failure\n\nDiagnostic & Repair Procedure\n\nInspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector.

    "Meaning": "P0267 Cylinder 3 Injector Circuit Low",
    "Common Causes": "This code implies that the powertrain control module (PCM) has experienced a low voltage situation involving the fuel injector for the #3 cylinder in the firing order. \nIn short, this fuel injector is malfunctioning for one of a variety of reasons. It is important to diagnose and repair this type of problem as soon as possible. \nWhen a fuel injector malfunctions, it causes ripples down the line, meaning the engine's operating parameters change due to the mixed signals at the PCM.\nIf the fuel injector spray pattern is reduced, a lean mixture will result. The ripple begins. The oxygen sensor signals a lean mixture to the PCM. In response, it richens the fuel mixture to all cylinders. Fuel economy plummets. \nThe cylinder with the faulty injector causes a lean mixture that in turn causes a higher cylinder head temperature resulting in detonation. The knock sensor senses the detonation, signals the PCM which responds by retarding the timing. Now the engine is running rough and lacks power.\nThis is not the end of the ripple effect, but it reflects the general idea. \nCross-section diagram of a typical automotive fuel injector (provided by WikipedianProlific):\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0267 code may include:\n\nThe check engine light will illuminate and code P0267 will set\nThe engine will run rougher than normal\nA lack of power\nA big drop in fuel economy will result \n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this DTC include:\n\nDirty fuel injector supplying the number three cylinder\nFaulty fuel injector\nPlugged fuel injector\nOpen or short in the fuel injector harness\nLoose or corroded fuel injector connector \n\nDiagnosis / Repair\nGenerally, this type of problem is either a loose or corroded electrical connector on the injector, a fouled injector (dirty or plugged) or a bad injector needing replacement.\nIn over 45 years I have found that loose or corroded connectors were the cause of the electrical fault the majority of the time. I have found but a few cases where low voltage wiring became shorted or open (when left undisturbed).\nThe majority of electrical problems were alternator related, starter solenoid wiring, oxygen sensor wiring due to the close proximity to the exhaust and battery related. The majority of electrical work was correcting customer-installed items such as high-power stereos and other parts or equipment installed incorrectly. \nThe fuel injectors get their power from the fuel pump relay. The PCM actuates the relay as the key is turned on. This means, as long as the key is on, the injectors have power. \nThe PCM activates the injector by supplying the ground at the necessary time and for the proper duration.\n\n Check the connector on the fuel injector. It is a plastic connector secured to the injector with a wire clip around the connector. Pull on the connector to see if it comes off easily. Remove the wire clip and pull the connector off the injector.\nInspect the harness connector for corrosion or pushed out pins. Make sure the two blades are not bent in the injector itself. Correct any defect and apply dielectric grease and install the electrical connector.\nStart the engine and listen to the injector to ensure it is working. Use a long screwdriver to the injector and the handle to your ear and you can hear it clearly. If it isn't making a highly audible 'clicking' noise, it either has no electrical power to it or it has failed. \n If it was not clicking, pull the connector off the injector and check for power with a voltmeter. No power means the wiring to the fuel pump relay is at fault or has a loose connection. If it has power, probe both terminals on the harness connector and if the PCM injector driver is operating, the voltmeter will indicate rapid pulses. If pulses are seen, replace the injector. \nIf the injector was operating, then it is either plugged or dirty. Attempt to clean it first. The kit to flush the injectors is inexpensive and will benefit the remaining injectors, possibly preventing a recurrence. If the flushing fails to solve the problem, the injector needs to be replaced. \n\nPurchase online or from an auto parts store  a \"direct\" injector flushing kit. It will consist of a bottle of high-pressure injector cleaner and a hose with an end for the injector cleaner bottle to thread onto. \n\nPull the fuse to the fuel pump. \nStart the vehicle and let it run until it dies from lack of fuel. \nRemove and plug the fuel return line attached to the fuel pressure regulator. This is to prevent the cleaner from returning to the fuel tank. \nRemove the schrader valve in the fuel rail test port. Install the flush kit fuel line to this test port. Thread the high-pressure fuel injection cleaner bottle on the flush kit fuel line. \nStart the engine and allow it to run until it runs out of fuel. It will be running on the cleaner bottle alone. \nWhen the engine quits, turn the key off and remove the flush kit line and replace the schrader valve. Install the fuel pump fuse. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n12 Ford Figo code error P0303 and P0267 illuminated in together12 Ford Figo, very similar to 09 Fiesta if you don't know the Figo, it's more popular in UK, Middle East and Asia (India mostly/made in India).\n\n1.6 L Duratec gasoline fuel.\n\nThe engine ripples between 2000-2500 rpm, and the engine light comes on, one or two time the car turned off when it comes to ...\u00a003 Jetta 2.0 P0261 P0267 P0270 P0264 P0445 P0037 P0418 & more03 Jetta 2.0 sometimes will not start ran very erretically today then ran fine\n\nI read these codes with a cheap scan tool today after clearing all codes the day before. the car would barely run on the way to work, but started and ran just fine on the way home.\nit has been leaving me stranded every n...\u00a0Peugeot 407 P0480 P0075 P0267 P0273 P0264 P0081 P0443 P0204I'm in dire need of help.

The knock sensor senses the detonation, signals the PCM which responds by retarding the timing. Now the engine is running rough and lacks power.\nThis is not the end of the ripple effect, but it reflects the general idea. \nCross-section diagram of a typical automotive fuel injector (provided by WikipedianProlific):\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0270 code may include:\n\nThe check engine light will illuminate and code P0270 will set\nThe engine will run rougher than normal\nA lack of power\nA big drop in fuel economy will result \n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this DTC include:\n\nDirty fuel injector supplying the number four cylinder\nFaulty fuel injector\nPlugged fuel injector\nOpen or short in the fuel injector harness\nLoose or corroded fuel injector connector \n\nDiagnosis / Repair\nGenerally, this type of problem is either a loose or corroded electrical connector on the injector, a fouled injector (dirty or plugged) or a bad injector needing replacement.\nIn over 45 years I have found that loose or corroded connectors were the cause of the electrical fault the majority of the time. I have found but a few cases where low voltage wiring became shorted or open (when left undisturbed).\nThe majority of electrical problems were alternator related, starter solenoid wiring, oxygen sensor wiring due to the close proximity to the exhaust and battery related. The majority of electrical work was correcting customer-installed items such as high-power stereos and other parts or equipment installed incorrectly. \nThe fuel injectors get their power from the fuel pump relay. The PCM actuates the relay as the key is turned on. This means, as long as the key is on, the injectors have power. \nThe PCM activates the injector by supplying the ground at the necessary time and for the proper duration.\n\n Check the connector on the fuel injector. It is a plastic connector secured to the injector with a wire clip around the connector. Pull on the connector to see if it comes off easily. Remove the wire clip and pull the connector off the injector.\nInspect the harness connector for corrosion or pushed out pins. Make sure the two blades are not bent in the injector itself. Correct any defect and apply dielectric grease and install the electrical connector.\nStart the engine and listen to the injector to ensure it is working. Use a long screwdriver to the injector and the handle to your ear and you can hear it clearly. If it isn't making a highly audible 'clicking' noise, it either has no electrical power to it or it has failed. \n If it was not clicking, pull the connector off the injector and check for power with a voltmeter. No power means the wiring to the fuel pump relay is at fault or has a loose connection. If it has power, probe both terminals on the harness connector and if the PCM injector driver is operating, the voltmeter will indicate rapid pulses. If pulses are seen, replace the injector. \nIf the injector was operating, then it is either plugged or dirty. Attempt to clean it first. The kit to flush the injectors is inexpensive and will benefit the remaining injectors, possibly preventing a recurrence. If the flushing fails to solve the problem, the injector needs to be replaced. \n\nPurchase online or from an auto parts store  a \"direct\" injector flushing kit. It will consist of a bottle of high-pressure injector cleaner and a hose with an end for the injector cleaner bottle to thread onto. \n\nPull the fuse to the fuel pump. \nStart the vehicle and let it run until it dies from lack of fuel. \nRemove and plug the fuel return line attached to the fuel pressure regulator. This is to prevent the cleaner from returning to the fuel tank. \nRemove the schrader valve in the fuel rail test port. Install the flush kit fuel line to this test port. Thread the high-pressure fuel injection cleaner bottle on the flush kit fuel line. \nStart the engine and allow it to run until it runs out of fuel. It will be running on the cleaner bottle alone. \nWhen the engine quits, turn the key off and remove the flush kit line and replace the schrader valve. Install the fuel pump fuse. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n'01 Maxima SE P0270Have a 2001 Nissan Maxima SE spitting out \"P0270 - Output speed sensor circuit malfunction\" - My question, is this code specific only to the speed sensor?

The wiring harness to the powertrain control module (PCM) is not easily accessible, and left undisturbed is seldom faulty. \nThe fuel injector, on the other hand, is susceptible to a variety of problems. The number one problem is fuel with anhydrous ethanol content. This fuel additive reduces the oil base fuel consumption. \nThe water vapor produced with E10 anhydrous ethanol has an adverse effect on the fuel injectors. They rely on fuel for lubrication. Water vapor reduces the friction reducing attributes of gasoline and causes premature wear in the injector. \nSmall engine manufacturers do not endorse the use of ethanol based fuels as they significantly reduce the service life of a small engine. \n\n Inspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector.

It is important to diagnose and repair this type of problem as soon as possible. \nWhen a fuel injector malfunctions, it causes ripples down the line, meaning the engine's operating parameters change due to the mixed signals at the PCM.\nIf the fuel injector spray pattern is reduced, a lean mixture will result. The ripple begins. The oxygen sensor signals a lean mixture to the PCM. In response, it richens the fuel mixture to all cylinders. Fuel economy plummets. \nThe cylinder with the faulty injector causes a lean mixture that in turn causes a higher cylinder head temperature resulting in detonation. The knock sensor senses the detonation, signals the PCM which responds by retarding the timing.

I have found but a few cases where low voltage wiring became shorted or open (when left undisturbed).\nThe majority of electrical problems were alternator related, starter solenoid wiring, oxygen sensor wiring due to the close proximity to the exhaust and battery related. The majority of electrical work was correcting customer-installed items such as high-power stereos and other parts or equipment installed incorrectly. \nThe fuel injectors get their power from the fuel pump relay. The PCM actuates the relay as the key is turned on. This means, as long as the key is on, the injectors have power. \nThe PCM activates the injector by supplying the ground at the necessary time and for the proper duration.\n\n Check the connector on the fuel injector.

I have found but a few cases where low voltage wiring became shorted or open (when left undisturbed).\nThe majority of electrical problems were alternator related, starter solenoid wiring, oxygen sensor wiring due to the close proximity to the exhaust and battery related. The majority of electrical work was correcting customer-installed items such as high-power stereos and other parts or equipment installed incorrectly. \nThe fuel injectors get their power from the fuel pump relay. The PCM actuates the relay as the key is turned on. This means, as long as the key is on, the injectors have power. \nThe PCM activates the injector by supplying the ground at the necessary time and for the proper duration.\n\n Check the connector on the fuel injector. It is a plastic connector secured to the injector with a wire clip around the connector. Pull on the connector to see if it comes off easily. Remove the wire clip and pull the connector off the injector.\nInspect the harness connector for corrosion or pushed out pins. Make sure the two blades are not bent in the injector itself. Correct any defect and apply dielectric grease and install the electrical connector.\nStart the engine and listen to the injector to ensure it is working. Use a long screwdriver to the injector and the handle to your ear and you can hear it clearly. If it isn't making a highly audible 'clicking' noise, it either has no electrical power to it or it has failed. \n If it was not clicking, pull the connector off the injector and check for power with a voltmeter. No power means the wiring to the fuel pump relay is at fault or has a loose connection. If it has power, probe both terminals on the harness connector and if the PCM injector driver is operating, the voltmeter will indicate rapid pulses. If pulses are seen, replace the injector. \nIf the injector was operating, then it is either plugged or dirty. Attempt to clean it first. The kit to flush the injectors is inexpensive and will benefit the remaining injectors, possibly preventing a recurrence.

It may be noted that although this code is common to all vehicles, the prognosis may vary between manufacturers. \nFor example, they may have been experiencing problems with a batch of fuel injectors, or some other defective item within the circuit limited to their particular vehicles.\nThis type of problem is better addressed as soon as possible to prevent damage to other internal components. A bad fuel injector will effect the spark plug, cause detonation, effects the oxygen sensor and catalytic converter, and several other components as well. \nGo online and access the technical service bulletins (TSBs) for your specific vehicle.

The wiring harness to the powertrain control module (PCM) is not easily accessible, and left undisturbed is seldom faulty. \nThe fuel injector, on the other hand, is susceptible to a variety of problems. The number one problem is fuel with anhydrous ethanol content. This fuel additive reduces the oil base fuel consumption. \nThe water vapor produced with E10 anhydrous ethanol has an adverse effect on the fuel injectors. They rely on fuel for lubrication. Water vapor reduces the friction reducing attributes of gasoline and causes premature wear in the injector. \nSmall engine manufacturers do not endorse the use of ethanol based fuels as they significantly reduce the service life of a small engine. \n\n Inspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Look for bent or pushed out pins. Install some dielectric grease and push the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Make sure it is a tight fit and the metal spring retaining clip is in place\n Start the engine. Place a long screwdriver handle to your ear and the tip on the fuel injector. A clicking sound indicates a working injector. No sound is the opposite\nDisconnect the fuel injector. With an ohmmeter, check the resistance between the two male terminal blades. A good injector will have 0.5 to 2.0 ohms. More or less ohms indicates an injector with an internal short. \nIf the resistance is correct and the injector could be heard operating, the next step is to attempt to clean the injector. If cleaning fails to restore the injector to normal operating parameters, the only alternative is to replace the injector. \nPurchase a 'direct injection cleaner kit consisting of a can of cleaner and a injection hose. Pull the fuel pump fuse and start the engine. Allow it to run until it stalls. \nRemove the schrader valve from the fuel pressure test port on the fuel rail. Install the hose on the test port. \nPinch off the fuel return line directly behind the fuel pressure regulator using a needle nose vise grips. \nOpen the bottle of cleaner to build pressure in the fuel rail. \nStart the engine and allow it to run on the bottle of fuel injection cleaner until it stalls. \nTurn off the key and remove the cleaner hose from the test port.

    "Meaning": "P0282 Cylinder 8 Injector Circuit Low",
    "Common Causes": "This code implies that the powertrain control module (PCM) has experienced a low voltage situation involving the fuel injector for the #8 cylinder in the firing order. \nIn short, this fuel injector is malfunctioning for one of a variety of reasons. It is important to diagnose and repair this type of problem as soon as possible. \nWhen a fuel injector malfunctions, it causes ripples down the line, meaning the engine's operating parameters change due to the mixed signals at the PCM.\nIf the fuel injector spray pattern is reduced, a lean mixture will result. The ripple begins. The oxygen sensor signals a lean mixture to the PCM. In response, it richens the fuel mixture to all cylinders. Fuel economy plummets. \nThe cylinder with the faulty injector causes a lean mixture that in turn causes a higher cylinder head temperature resulting in detonation. The knock sensor senses the detonation, signals the PCM which responds by retarding the timing. Now the engine is running rough and lacks power.\nThis is not the end of the ripple effect, but it reflects the general idea. \nCross-section diagram of a typical automotive fuel injector (provided by WikipedianProlific):\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0282 code may include:\n\nThe check engine light will illuminate and code P0282 will set\nThe engine will run rougher than normal\nA lack of power\nA big drop in fuel economy will result \n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this DTC include:\n\nDirty fuel injector supplying the number eight cylinder\nFaulty fuel injector\nPlugged fuel injector\nOpen or short in the fuel injector harness\nLoose or corroded fuel injector connector \n\nDiagnosis / Repair\nGenerally, this type of problem is either a loose or corroded electrical connector on the injector, a fouled injector (dirty or plugged) or a bad injector needing replacement.\nIn over 45 years I have found that loose or corroded connectors were the cause of the electrical fault the majority of the time. I have found but a few cases where low voltage wiring became shorted or open (when left undisturbed).\nThe majority of electrical problems were alternator related, starter solenoid wiring, oxygen sensor wiring due to the close proximity to the exhaust and battery related. The majority of electrical work was correcting customer-installed items such as high-power stereos and other parts or equipment installed incorrectly. \nThe fuel injectors get their power from the fuel pump relay. The PCM actuates the relay as the key is turned on. This means, as long as the key is on, the injectors have power. \nThe PCM activates the injector by supplying the ground at the necessary time and for the proper duration.\n\n Check the connector on the fuel injector. It is a plastic connector secured to the injector with a wire clip around the connector. Pull on the connector to see if it comes off easily. Remove the wire clip and pull the connector off the injector.\nInspect the harness connector for corrosion or pushed out pins. Make sure the two blades are not bent in the injector itself. Correct any defect and apply dielectric grease and install the electrical connector.\nStart the engine and listen to the injector to ensure it is working. Use a long screwdriver to the injector and the handle to your ear and you can hear it clearly. If it isn't making a highly audible 'clicking' noise, it either has no electrical power to it or it has failed. \n If it was not clicking, pull the connector off the injector and check for power with a voltmeter. No power means the wiring to the fuel pump relay is at fault or has a loose connection. If it has power, probe both terminals on the harness connector and if the PCM injector driver is operating, the voltmeter will indicate rapid pulses. If pulses are seen, replace the injector. \nIf the injector was operating, then it is either plugged or dirty. Attempt to clean it first. The kit to flush the injectors is inexpensive and will benefit the remaining injectors, possibly preventing a recurrence. If the flushing fails to solve the problem, the injector needs to be replaced. \n\nPurchase online or from an auto parts store  a \"direct\" injector flushing kit. It will consist of a bottle of high-pressure injector cleaner and a hose with an end for the injector cleaner bottle to thread onto. \n\nPull the fuse to the fuel pump. \nStart the vehicle and let it run until it dies from lack of fuel. \nRemove and plug the fuel return line attached to the fuel pressure regulator. This is to prevent the cleaner from returning to the fuel tank. \nRemove the schrader valve in the fuel rail test port. Install the flush kit fuel line to this test port. Thread the high-pressure fuel injection cleaner bottle on the flush kit fuel line. \nStart the engine and allow it to run until it runs out of fuel. It will be running on the cleaner bottle alone. \nWhen the engine quits, turn the key off and remove the flush kit line and replace the schrader valve.

It may be noted that although this code is common to all vehicles, the prognosis may vary between manufacturers. \nFor example, they may have been experiencing problems with a batch of fuel injectors, or some other defective item within the circuit limited to their particular vehicles.\nThis type of problem is better addressed as soon as possible to prevent damage to other internal components. A bad fuel injector will effect the spark plug, cause detonation, effects the oxygen sensor and catalytic converter, and several other components as well. \nGo online and access the technical service bulletins (TSBs) for your specific vehicle.

The wiring harness to the powertrain control module (PCM) is not easily accessible, and left undisturbed is seldom faulty. \nThe fuel injector, on the other hand, is susceptible to a variety of problems. The number one problem is fuel with anhydrous ethanol content. This fuel additive reduces the oil base fuel consumption. \nThe water vapor produced with E10 anhydrous ethanol has an adverse effect on the fuel injectors. They rely on fuel for lubrication. Water vapor reduces the friction reducing attributes of gasoline and causes premature wear in the injector. \nSmall engine manufacturers do not endorse the use of ethanol based fuels as they significantly reduce the service life of a small engine. \n\n Inspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Look for bent or pushed out pins. Install some dielectric grease and push the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Make sure it is a tight fit and the metal spring retaining clip is in place\n Start the engine. Place a long screwdriver handle to your ear and the tip on the fuel injector. A clicking sound indicates a working injector. No sound is the opposite\nDisconnect the fuel injector. With an ohmmeter, check the resistance between the two male terminal blades. A good injector will have 0.5 to 2.0 ohms. More or less ohms indicates an injector with an internal short. \nIf the resistance is correct and the injector could be heard operating, the next step is to attempt to clean the injector. If cleaning fails to restore the injector to normal operating parameters, the only alternative is to replace the injector. \nPurchase a 'direct injection cleaner kit consisting of a can of cleaner and a injection hose. Pull the fuel pump fuse and start the engine. Allow it to run until it stalls. \nRemove the schrader valve from the fuel pressure test port on the fuel rail.

It is important to diagnose and repair this type of problem as soon as possible. \nWhen a fuel injector malfunctions, it causes ripples down the line, meaning the engine's operating parameters change due to the mixed signals at the PCM.\nIf the fuel injector spray pattern is reduced, a lean mixture will result. The ripple begins. The oxygen sensor signals a lean mixture to the PCM. In response, it richens the fuel mixture to all cylinders. Fuel economy plummets. \nThe cylinder with the faulty injector causes a lean mixture that in turn causes a higher cylinder head temperature resulting in detonation. The knock sensor senses the detonation, signals the PCM which responds by retarding the timing. Now the engine is running rough and lacks power.\nThis is not the end of the ripple effect, but it reflects the general idea. \nCross-section diagram of a typical automotive fuel injector (provided by WikipedianProlific):\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms displayed for a P0288 code may include:\n\nThe check engine light will illuminate and code P0288 will set\nThe engine will run rougher than normal\nA lack of power\nA big drop in fuel economy will result \n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this DTC include:\n\nDirty fuel injector supplying the number ten cylinder\nFaulty fuel injector\nPlugged fuel injector\nOpen or short in the fuel injector harness\nLoose or corroded fuel injector connector \n\nDiagnosis / Repair\nGenerally, this type of problem is either a loose or corroded electrical connector on the injector, a fouled injector (dirty or plugged) or a bad injector needing replacement.\nIn over 45 years I have found that loose or corroded connectors were the cause of the electrical fault the majority of the time. I have found but a few cases where low voltage wiring became shorted or open (when left undisturbed).\nThe majority of electrical problems were alternator related, starter solenoid wiring, oxygen sensor wiring due to the close proximity to the exhaust and battery related. The majority of electrical work was correcting customer-installed items such as high-power stereos and other parts or equipment installed incorrectly. \nThe fuel injectors get their power from the fuel pump relay. The PCM actuates the relay as the key is turned on. This means, as long as the key is on, the injectors have power. \nThe PCM activates the injector by supplying the ground at the necessary time and for the proper duration.\n\n Check the connector on the fuel injector. It is a plastic connector secured to the injector with a wire clip around the connector. Pull on the connector to see if it comes off easily. Remove the wire clip and pull the connector off the injector.\nInspect the harness connector for corrosion or pushed out pins. Make sure the two blades are not bent in the injector itself. Correct any defect and apply dielectric grease and install the electrical connector.\nStart the engine and listen to the injector to ensure it is working. Use a long screwdriver to the injector and the handle to your ear and you can hear it clearly. If it isn't making a highly audible 'clicking' noise, it either has no electrical power to it or it has failed. \n If it was not clicking, pull the connector off the injector and check for power with a voltmeter. No power means the wiring to the fuel pump relay is at fault or has a loose connection. If it has power, probe both terminals on the harness connector and if the PCM injector driver is operating, the voltmeter will indicate rapid pulses. If pulses are seen, replace the injector. \nIf the injector was operating, then it is either plugged or dirty. Attempt to clean it first. The kit to flush the injectors is inexpensive and will benefit the remaining injectors, possibly preventing a recurrence. If the flushing fails to solve the problem, the injector needs to be replaced. \n\nPurchase online or from an auto parts store  a \"direct\" injector flushing kit. It will consist of a bottle of high-pressure injector cleaner and a hose with an end for the injector cleaner bottle to thread onto. \n\nPull the fuse to the fuel pump. \nStart the vehicle and let it run until it dies from lack of fuel. \nRemove and plug the fuel return line attached to the fuel pressure regulator. This is to prevent the cleaner from returning to the fuel tank. \nRemove the schrader valve in the fuel rail test port. Install the flush kit fuel line to this test port. Thread the high-pressure fuel injection cleaner bottle on the flush kit fuel line. \nStart the engine and allow it to run until it runs out of fuel. It will be running on the cleaner bottle alone. \nWhen the engine quits, turn the key off and remove the flush kit line and replace the schrader valve.

The wiring harness to the powertrain control module (PCM) is not easily accessible, and left undisturbed is seldom faulty. \nThe fuel injector, on the other hand, is susceptible to a variety of problems. The number one problem is fuel with anhydrous ethanol content. This fuel additive reduces the oil base fuel consumption. \nThe water vapor produced with E10 anhydrous ethanol has an adverse effect on the fuel injectors. They rely on fuel for lubrication. Water vapor reduces the friction reducing attributes of gasoline and causes premature wear in the injector. \nSmall engine manufacturers do not endorse the use of ethanol based fuels as they significantly reduce the service life of a small engine. \n\n Inspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Look for bent or pushed out pins. Install some dielectric grease and push the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Make sure it is a tight fit and the metal spring retaining clip is in place\n Start the engine. Place a long screwdriver handle to your ear and the tip on the fuel injector. A clicking sound indicates a working injector. No sound is the opposite\nDisconnect the fuel injector. With an ohmmeter, check the resistance between the two male terminal blades. A good injector will have 0.5 to 2.0 ohms. More or less ohms indicates an injector with an internal short. \nIf the resistance is correct and the injector could be heard operating, the next step is to attempt to clean the injector.

This means, as long as the key is on, the injectors have power. \nThe PCM activates the injector by supplying the ground at the necessary time and for the proper duration.\n\n Check the connector on the fuel injector. It is a plastic connector secured to the injector with a wire clip around the connector. Pull on the connector to see if it comes off easily. Remove the wire clip and pull the connector off the injector.\nInspect the harness connector for corrosion or pushed out pins. Make sure the two blades are not bent in the injector itself. Correct any defect and apply dielectric grease and install the electrical connector.\nStart the engine and listen to the injector to ensure it is working. Use a long screwdriver to the injector and the handle to your ear and you can hear it clearly. If it isn't making a highly audible 'clicking' noise, it either has no electrical power to it or it has failed. \n If it was not clicking, pull the connector off the injector and check for power with a voltmeter. No power means the wiring to the fuel pump relay is at fault or has a loose connection. If it has power, probe both terminals on the harness connector and if the PCM injector driver is operating, the voltmeter will indicate rapid pulses. If pulses are seen, replace the injector. \nIf the injector was operating, then it is either plugged or dirty. Attempt to clean it first. The kit to flush the injectors is inexpensive and will benefit the remaining injectors, possibly preventing a recurrence. If the flushing fails to solve the problem, the injector needs to be replaced. \n\nPurchase online or from an auto parts store  a \"direct\" injector flushing kit. It will consist of a bottle of high-pressure injector cleaner and a hose with an end for the injector cleaner bottle to thread onto. \n\nPull the fuse to the fuel pump. \nStart the vehicle and let it run until it dies from lack of fuel. \nRemove and plug the fuel return line attached to the fuel pressure regulator. This is to prevent the cleaner from returning to the fuel tank. \nRemove the schrader valve in the fuel rail test port. Install the flush kit fuel line to this test port. Thread the high-pressure fuel injection cleaner bottle on the flush kit fuel line. \nStart the engine and allow it to run until it runs out of fuel. It will be running on the cleaner bottle alone. \nWhen the engine quits, turn the key off and remove the flush kit line and replace the schrader valve. Install the fuel pump fuse. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n1998 breeze code p0294DTC P0294 Cylinder 12 Injector Circuit Low \n\nthis is what it comes up as but i cant find out what the problem is or where to start? some one please help.[/code]...\u00a0\nNeed more help with a p0294 code?\nIf you still need help regarding the P0294 trouble code, please post \n  your question in our FREE car repair forums.\nWe are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n\nShare\n\n\nNOTE: This information is presented for information purposes only. \n  It is not intended as repair advice and we are not responsible for any actions \n  you take on any vehicle.

It may be noted that although this code is common to all vehicles, the prognosis may vary between manufacturers. \nFor example, they may have been experiencing problems with a batch of fuel injectors, or some other defective item within the circuit limited to their particular vehicles.\nThis type of problem is better addressed as soon as possible to prevent damage to other internal components. A bad fuel injector will effect the spark plug, cause detonation, effects the oxygen sensor and catalytic converter, and several other components as well. \nGo online and access the technical service bulletins (TSBs) for your specific vehicle.

The wiring harness to the powertrain control module (PCM) is not easily accessible, and left undisturbed is seldom faulty. \nThe fuel injector, on the other hand, is susceptible to a variety of problems. The number one problem is fuel with anhydrous ethanol content. This fuel additive reduces the oil base fuel consumption. \nThe water vapor produced with E10 anhydrous ethanol has an adverse effect on the fuel injectors. They rely on fuel for lubrication. Water vapor reduces the friction reducing attributes of gasoline and causes premature wear in the injector. \nSmall engine manufacturers do not endorse the use of ethanol based fuels as they significantly reduce the service life of a small engine. \n\n Inspect the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Look for bent or pushed out pins. Install some dielectric grease and push the electrical connector on the fuel injector. Make sure it is a tight fit and the metal spring retaining clip is in place\n Start the engine. Place a long screwdriver handle to your ear and the tip on the fuel injector. A clicking sound indicates a working injector. No sound is the opposite\nDisconnect the fuel injector. With an ohmmeter, check the resistance between the two male terminal blades. A good injector will have 0.5 to 2.0 ohms. More or less ohms indicates an injector with an internal short. \nIf the resistance is correct and the injector could be heard operating, the next step is to attempt to clean the injector. If cleaning fails to restore the injector to normal operating parameters, the only alternative is to replace the injector. \nPurchase a 'direct injection cleaner kit consisting of a can of cleaner and a injection hose. Pull the fuel pump fuse and start the engine. Allow it to run until it stalls. \nRemove the schrader valve from the fuel pressure test port on the fuel rail.

  "P0297": {
    "Meaning": "P0297 Vehicle Overspeed Condition",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM, in most production vehicles sold in North America, is programmed to limit actual vehicle speed to 100 mph. When a VSS signal is received that indicates the vehicle has reached this speed, the PCM is programmed to discontinue the fuel injector pulse signal to all cylinders. This causes an immediate loss of momentum and vehicle speed is decreased. Once vehicle speed returns to an acceptable level, the injector pulse signal is restored and acceleration is enabled. \nTypically, the VSS is an electromagnetic sensor that uses a rotating reluctor ring to complete an input circuit to the PCM. The VSS is mounted in the transmission housing at such a position as to allow the reluctor ring to pass by it; in close proximity. The reluctor ring is attached to the output shaft of the transmission so that it spins along with it. As the reluctor ring passes by the electromagnetic tip of the VSS, notches and grooves serve to complete and interrupt the circuit rapidly. These circuit manipulations are recognized by the PCM as transmission output speed or vehicle speed. \nA typical VSS or vehicle speed sensor:\n\nIf the PCM detects a VSS reading that indicates the vehicle has exceeded the maximum allowable speed, a code P0287 will be stored (on some vehicles) and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated. In some cases, multiple failure cycles will be required for a MIL to be illuminated. This code belongs in the P0200-P02FF batch of diagnostic codes.\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nDepending upon the symptoms exhibited with a Code P0297, it could be considered severe. If shifting abnormalities or transmission control codes accompany the P0297, it should be addressed with urgency. \nSymptoms of a P0297 engine code may include: \n\nMost commonly, no symptoms will accompany a P0297\nOther transmission control codes\nTransmission shifting irregularities\nAntilock Brake System (ABS) codes\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this P0297 code may include: \n\nThe vehicle has been operated in excess of the maximum allowable speed\nDefective VSS or VSS reluctor ring\nMechanical transmission failure\nVSS system circuits shorted to voltage\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source will be among the tools required to diagnose a code P0297.\nAllow me to begin by suggesting that you make sure that the vehicle has not been operated above the maximum allowable speed. If the vehicle has been inadvertently operated above the maximum speed, connect the diagnostic scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored codes. You will want to write this information down (along with any available freeze frame data) as it can be helpful as your diagnosis unfolds. \nNow, simply clear the code and test-drive the vehicle to make sure that it is not reset. Operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters readiness mode or a code is stored. If the code P0297 is stored after being cleared, you know that there is a malfunction. If the PCM enters readiness mode, you are good-to-go.  If the P0297 is reset, and there are no other transmission symptoms or codes, suspect a VSS problem. \nTest the VSS\nUnplug the electrical connector from the VSS and use the DVOM to test the resistance of the sensor itself. Consult your vehicle information source for specific testing procedures and specifications. Replace the sensor if it fails to comply with manufacturer\u2019s recommended specs.\nTest Reference Voltage and Ground\nIf the VSS is within specifications, check for reference voltage and a ground at the sensor connector. With the sensor unplugged, use the DVOM to check for an acceptable reference voltage signal (usually 5-volts) and a ground on the appropriate pins. If there is not an acceptable reference voltage signal at the VSS connector, use the DVOM to test the corresponding circuit at the PCM connector. If you discover an acceptable reference voltage signal at the PCM connector, suspect a defective wire, splice, or connector between the PCM and the VSS. A false overspeed condition is more likely to be caused by a circuit that is shorted to voltage than an open circuit. If there is no ground at the VSS connector, consult your vehicle information source for the location of system grounds and carefully check them with the DVOM. Make repairs as required.\nTest VSS System Circuits\nIf the reference and ground are both present at the VSS connector, test all VSS system circuits. Prior to using the DVOM to test continuity on system circuits, disconnect all related controllers. Test individual system circuits using the DVOM and repair or replace any circuits which do not adhere to manufacturer\u2019s specifications. If all system circuits are in order, suspect a defective PCM. \n PCM failure is rare\nActual overspeed vehicle operation is the leading cause of a stored code P0297\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0298": {
    "Meaning": "P0298 Engine Oil Over Temperature Condition",
    "Common Causes": "Not every vehicle is equipped with a system that monitors oil temperature. Personally, I have only encountered oil temperature monitoring systems on diesel applications. Engine oil temperature sensors are typically negative coefficient thermistors which decrease circuit resistance as oil temperature is elevated. The oil temperature monitoring circuit begins with a reference voltage signal (usually 5-volts), applied to the sensor. When engine oil is at or near ambient temperature, oil temperature sensor resistance is high and that keeps oil temperature sensor circuit voltage low (normally near .5-volts).\nAs oil temperature increases, and sensor resistance decreases, circuit voltage becomes greater. The PCM is programmed to recognize these variations in sensor circuit voltage as varying degrees of oil temperature. In some cases, the engine oil temperature sensor also provides an engine oil temperature gauge with an electrical signal that is displayed on the instrument panel for driver convenience.\nIf the PCM detects a level of engine oil temperature sensor circuit voltage that is not within the programmed parameters, a code P0298 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\nA typical engine oil temperature sensor:\nThis code belongs in the P0200-P02FF batch of diagnostic codes.

While it is always a good idea to visually inspect system wiring and connectors prior to beginning your diagnosis in this case, it is most important that you make sure that the engine is full (to the appropriate limit and with the correct type) of good quality oil and engine coolant.\nA note about overheating\nEngine overheating is the leading cause of oil over temp conditions. Engine overheating may be the result of a coolant leak, a bad thermostat, cylinder head (or gasket) malfunctions, or an air flow problem. Make sure that the engine cooling system is filled with coolant and that all of the fans are operating as intended. If the engine cooling system is more than a half-gallon low, locate the source of the coolant leak and repair it.\nWith the engine cooling system filled with the proper coolant and working normally and the crankcase properly filled with oil, connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Having this information written down can be helpful as your diagnosis proceeds. After you have made a note of all stored codes and related data, clear the codes and operate the vehicle to see if the P0298 is reset.\nIf the engine is not overheating:\n\n And the engine oil temperature sensor code fails to reset, continue to operate the vehicle normally until the PCM enters readiness mode or the code is reset. If the PCM enters readiness mode; your problems are solved. If the code is reset; a malfunction persists.\nAnd the P0298 is reset, unplug the engine oil temperature sensor connector and use the DVOM to check for a reference voltage signal and a ground at the connector. \n\nTesting\n\n If there is a reference voltage signal and ground present, use the DVOM and the vehicle information source to test sensor resistance. Replace the sensor if it fails to conform to specifications.\nIf there is no reference voltage at the sensor connector, locate the corresponding circuit at the PCM connector and use the DVOM to test for reference voltage there. If there is reference voltage at the PCM and none at the engine oil temp sensor, suspect a broken or shorted wire between the two.\nIf there is no reference voltage at the PCM connector, suspect a defective PCM or programming error.\nIf there is no ground at either the PCM connector or the engine oil temperature sensor connector, locate the appropriate ground junction and ensure that it is secure. A new ground can be added in a worst case scenario.\n\n\nAttempting to diagnose an overheating engine with a stored code P0289 is an effort in futility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nP0298 2007 Grand cherokee 3.7 lI have this new code now.

  "P0302": {
    "Meaning": "P0302 Cylinder 2 Misfire Detected",
    "Common Causes": "The reason for a code P0302 being stored in your OBD II vehicle is that the powertrain control module (PCM) has detected an individual cylinder misfire. A P0302 specifically applies to the number 2 cylinder. Consult a reliable vehicle information source for the location of the number 2 cylinder for the vehicle in question.\nThis type of code may be caused by a fuel delivery problem, a large vacuum leak, an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) malfunction, or mechanical engine failure, but is most often the result of an ignition system defect resulting in a low or no spark condition. \n\nVirtually all OBD II equipped vehicles use a distributor-less, coil-over-plug (COP), high-intensity spark, ignition system. It is controlled by the PCM to effect precise ignition spark and timing.\nThe PCM calculates input signals from the crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, and throttle position sensor (among others depending upon the vehicle) to configure an ignition spark timing strategy.\nIn a realistic sense, the camshaft position sensor and crankshaft position sensor are vital to operation of the OBD II ignition system. Using input signals from these sensors, the PCM delivers a voltage signal that causes the high-intensity ignition coils (usually one for each cylinder) to fire in sequential order.\nSince the crankshaft turns at a speed that is approximately twice as fast as the camshaft(s), it is crucial that the PCM knows their exact position; both overall and in relation to one another. A simple method of explaining this aspect of engine operation is this: \nTop dead center (TDC) is the point where the crankshaft and camshaft(s) align with the piston (for the number one cylinder) at its highest point and the intake valve(s) (for cylinder number one) opened. This is known as the compression stroke. \nDuring the compression stroke, air and fuel are drawn into the combustion chamber. At this point, an ignition spark is required to cause combustion. The PCM recognizes the position of the crankshaft and camshaft and initiates the voltage signal required to result in a high-intensity spark from the ignition coil. \nCombustion in the cylinder propels the piston back in a downward fashion. As the engine rolls through the compression stroke, and the number one piston begins to withdraw towards the crankshaft, the intake valve(s) is closed. This begins the exhaust stroke. As the crankshaft completes another revolution, the number one piston once again reaches its highest point. Since the camshaft(s) has only completed a half revolution, the intake valve remains closed and the exhaust valve is opened. At the top of the exhaust stroke, no ignition spark is required, as this stroke is used to push spent exhaust gases out of the cylinder, through the opening created by the open exhaust valve(s), and into the exhaust manifold.\nTypical high-intensity ignition coil operation is accomplished with a constant supply of fused, switched (only present with the ignition switch placed in the ON position) battery voltage and a ground pulse supplied (at the appropriate instant) by the PCM. When the ground pulse is applied to the ignition coil (primary) circuit, the coil emits a high-intensity spark (up to 50,000-volts) for a fraction of a second. This high-intensity spark is transferred through a spark plug wire or boot and a spark plug, which is threaded into the cylinder head or intake manifold, where it makes contact with a precise air/fuel mixture. The result is a controlled explosion. If this explosion fails to occur, the engine RPM level is affected and the PCM detects it. After that, the PCM monitors camshaft position, crankshaft position, and individual coil feedback voltage inputs to determine which cylinder has misfired or is currently misfiring. \nIf the cylinder misfire is not consistent or severe enough, the code may appear as pending and the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may only flash when the PCM actually detects a misfire (then go off when it does not). The system is designed in this fashion to alert the driver that an engine misfire of this degree can be harmful to the catalytic converter and other engine components. Once the misfire becomes more consistent and severe, a P0302 will be stored and constant MIL illumination will occur.\nCode Severity\nConditions which promote storage of a P0302 are likely to cause catalytic converter and/or engine damage. This code should be classified as severe.\nCode Symptoms\nSymptoms of a P0302 may include: \n Diminished engine performance\nRough or unstable feeling from engine (at idle or under light acceleration)\nOdd odor from engine exhaust\nFlashing or constant MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\n\nCauses\nA code P0302 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:\n\nDefective ignition coil(s)\nBad spark plug(s), spark plug wires, or spark plug boots\nFaulty fuel injector(s)\nMalfunctioning fuel delivery system (fuel pump, fuel pump relay, fuel injectors, or fuel filter)\nMajor engine vacuum leak\nEGR valve stuck in the wide open position\nClogged EGR ports \n\nDiagnosis & Repair Steps\nA diagnostic scanner, digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source will be required to diagnose a stored (or pending) code P0302.\n\n Begin your diagnosis with a visual inspection of the affected ignition coil, spark plug, and spark plug boot\nComponents that are contaminated with liquid (oil, engine coolant, or water) must be cleaned or replaced\nIf the recommended maintenance interval demands (all) spark plug replacement, this is a good time to do it\nInspect primary wiring and connectors, for the ignition coil in question, and make repairs as necessary\nKey-on-engine-running (KOER), listen for the presence of a large vacuum leak and make repairs if necessary\nIf lean exhaust codes or fuel supply codes accompany the misfire code, they should be diagnosed and repaired first\nAll EGR valve position codes should be rectified prior to diagnosing a misfire code\nInsufficient EGR flow codes should be addressed before diagnosing this code\n\nWith all of the above listed issues rectified, connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. I like to write this information down as it can be helpful later. Now, clear the codes and see if the P0302 is reset during a lengthy test drive.\nIf the code is reset, use your vehicle information source to search technical service bulletins (TSB) which pertain to the symptoms and code(s) in question. Since TSB lists are compiled from many thousands of repairs, the information found in the appropriate one will likely aid you in making a correct diagnosis. \nTake care to locate the cylinder which is misfiring. Once this is accomplished, you must pinpoint the exact cause of the malfunction. You may spend many hours in testing individual components but I have a simple system to accomplish this task. The procedure described is for a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission. Manual transmission equipped vehicles can also be tested this way but it is more challenging.\nIt is as follows:\n\n Determine within what RPM range the misfire most often occurs. This may be done by test driving or checking freeze frame data\nWith the RPM range determined, start the engine and allow it to reach normal operating temperature\nPlace a chock on both sides of the drive wheels of the vehicle\nHave an assistant get into the driver\u2019s seat and place the shifter in DRIVE with the parking brake set and their foot firmly pressing down on the brake pedal\nTake up a position alongside the front of the vehicle, so that you can reach the engine, with the hood open and secure\nHave the assistant gradually increase the RPM level by pressing the accelerator pedal until the misfire is exhibited\nWith the engine misfiring, CAREFULLY lift the ignition coil from its perch and note the degree of high-intensity spark being produced\nHigh-intensity spark should be bright blue in color and stunning in intensity. If it is not, suspect a defective ignition coil\nIf you are unsure about the level of spark produced by the coil in question, lift a known working coil from its perch and observe the degree of spark\nReplacement of the corresponding spark plug and boot/wire is recommended if the ignition coil must be replaced\nIf the ignition coil seems to be firing normally, turn the engine off and insert a known good spark plug in the boot/wire\nRestart the engine and have the assistant repeat the procedure\nObserve high-intensity spark across the spark plug. It should also be bright blue and intense in nature. If it is not, suspect a defective spark plug for the cylinder in question\nIf high-intensity spark (for the affected cylinder) seems normal, you may perform a similar test for the fuel injector by carefully disconnecting it to see if any difference in engine RPM is detected. A working fuel injector will also emit an audible ticking sound\nIf the fuel injector is inoperative, use a node light to test for voltage and a ground signal (at the injector connector) while the engine is running\n\nIn most cases, you will have found the cause of the misfire by the time you finish testing for high-intensity spark.\n\n EGR systems which use a system for injecting exhaust gases into individual cylinders are known to cause symptoms which simulate a misfire condition. The EGR cylinder portals clog and cause all of the EGR gases to be dumped into one cylinder, resulting in a misfire\nUse caution when testing high-intensity spark. 50,000-volts can be harmful or even fatal in extreme circumstances\nWhen testing high-intensity spark, keep it away from fuel sources to avoid catastrophe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2006 FORD F150 code P0302,P0304Hi changed sparkplufgs,coils,invert coils and injectors still have misfire on cylinder #2 & #4.\n\nHelp needed.\n\nBAST....\u00a02003 Honda Civic EX P0300, P0302, P0301, P0303, P0304Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n----------------------------------------------\n\nYear:\t2003\nMake:\tHonda\nModel:\tCivic\nEngine:\t1.7L SOHC 4 Cyl (D17A6)\nMileage:\t43000\n\nStored:\t \nP0301\tCylinder 1 Misfire Detected\nP0302\tCylinder 2 Misfire Detected\nP0303\tCylinder 3 Misfire Detected\nP0304\tCylinder 4 ...\u00a01998 neon P0201,P0202,P0302.P0300i have just bought my first dodge neon and i have a few codes that came up.i know what they are but dont know what could be causing the trouble.\nits a 1998 neon 2.0 SOHC 4 door auto 120,000 miles.it has a rough idle and even worse when ever its in gear.it stumbles and jerks when at a steady speed.wh...\u00a099 suburban code P0302I keep getting this code on my 5.7 engine, already replaced plugs, wires,\ncrankshaft sensor, fuel injector distibutor cap, I clear and reset the code\nbut the check engine light and same code returns after about 1 day. the \nlight flashes sometimes while on the highway. what else could the problem\nbe...\u00a02000 Montana p0302 and p0171This post refers to a 2000 Pontiac Montana, 3.4V6, AT, 158,000 miles.\n\nI recently did an intake cleaning because my oil analysis indicated dirty combustion chambers.

  "P0306": {
    "Meaning": "P0306 Cylinder 6 Misfire Detected",
    "Common Causes": "This type of code may be caused by a fuel delivery problem, a large vacuum leak, an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) malfunction, or mechanical engine failure, but is most often the result of an ignition system defect resulting in a low or no spark condition. \nVirtually all OBD II equipped vehicles use a distributor-less, coil-over-plug (COP), high-intensity spark, ignition system. It is controlled by the PCM to effect precise ignition spark and timing.\nThe PCM calculates input signals from the crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, and throttle position sensor (among others depending upon the vehicle) to configure an ignition spark timing strategy.\nIn a realistic sense, the camshaft position sensor and crankshaft position sensor are vital to operation of the OBD II ignition system. Using input signals from these sensors, the PCM delivers a voltage signal that causes the high-intensity ignition coils (usually one for each cylinder) to fire in sequential order.\nSince the crankshaft turns at a speed that is approximately twice as fast as the camshaft(s), it is crucial that the PCM knows their exact position; both overall and in relation to one another. A simple method of explaining this aspect of engine operation is this: \nTop dead center (TDC) is the point where the crankshaft and camshaft(s) align with the piston (for the number one cylinder) at its highest point and the intake valve(s) (for cylinder number one) opened. This is known as the compression stroke. \nDuring the compression stroke, air and fuel are drawn into the combustion chamber. At this point, an ignition spark is required to cause combustion. The PCM recognizes the position of the crankshaft and camshaft and initiates the voltage signal required to result in a high-intensity spark from the ignition coil. \nCombustion in the cylinder propels the piston back in a downward fashion. As the engine rolls through the compression stroke, and the number one piston begins to withdraw towards the crankshaft, the intake valve(s) is closed. This begins the exhaust stroke. As the crankshaft completes another revolution, the number one piston once again reaches its highest point. Since the camshaft(s) has only completed a half revolution, the intake valve remains closed and the exhaust valve is opened. At the top of the exhaust stroke, no ignition spark is required, as this stroke is used to push spent exhaust gases out of the cylinder, through the opening created by the open exhaust valve(s), and into the exhaust manifold.\nTypical high-intensity ignition coil operation is accomplished with a constant supply of fused, switched (only present with the ignition switch placed in the ON position) battery voltage and a ground pulse supplied (at the appropriate instant) by the PCM. When the ground pulse is applied to the ignition coil (primary) circuit, the coil emits a high-intensity spark (up to 50,000-volts) for a fraction of a second. This high-intensity spark is transferred through a spark plug wire or boot and a spark plug, which is threaded into the cylinder head or intake manifold, where it makes contact with a precise air/fuel mixture. The result is a controlled explosion. If this explosion fails to occur, the engine RPM level is affected and the PCM detects it. After that, the PCM monitors camshaft position, crankshaft position, and individual coil feedback voltage inputs to determine which cylinder has misfired or is currently misfiring. \nIf the cylinder misfire is not consistent or severe enough, the code may appear as pending and the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may only flash when the PCM actually detects a misfire (then go off when it does not). The system is designed in this fashion to alert the driver that an engine misfire of this degree can be harmful to the catalytic converter and other engine components. Once the misfire becomes more consistent and severe, a P0306 will be stored and constant MIL illumination will occur.\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nConditions which promote storage of a P0306 are likely to cause catalytic converter and/or engine damage. This code should be classified as severe.\nSymptoms may include: \n Diminished engine performance\nRough or unstable feeling from engine (at idle or under light acceleration)\nOdd odor from engine exhaust\nFlashing or constant MIL (malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\n\nCauses\nA code P0306 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:\n\n Defective ignition coil(s)\nBad spark plug(s), spark plug wires, or spark plug boots\nFaulty fuel injector(s)\nMalfunctioning fuel delivery system (fuel pump, fuel pump relay, fuel injectors, or fuel filter)\nMajor engine vacuum leak\nEGR valve stuck in the wide open position\nClogged EGR ports \n\nDiagnosis & Repair Steps\nA diagnostic scanner, digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source will be required to diagnose a stored (or pending) code P0306.\n\n Begin your diagnosis with a visual inspection of the affected ignition coil, spark plug, and spark plug boot\nComponents that are contaminated with liquid (oil, engine coolant, or water) must be cleaned or replaced\nIf the recommended maintenance interval demands (all) spark plug replacement, this is a good time to do it\nInspect primary wiring and connectors, for the ignition coil in question, and make repairs as necessary\nKey-on-engine-running (KOER), listen for the presence of a large vacuum leak and make repairs if necessary\nIf lean exhaust codes or fuel supply codes accompany the misfire code, they should be diagnosed and repaired first\nAll EGR valve position codes should be rectified prior to diagnosing a misfire code\nInsufficient EGR flow codes should be addressed before diagnosing this code\n\nWith all of the above listed issues rectified, connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. I like to write this information down as it can be helpful later. Now, clear the codes and see if the P0306 is reset during a lengthy test drive.\nIf the code is reset, use your vehicle information source to search technical service bulletins (TSB) which pertain to the symptoms and code(s) in question. Since TSB lists are compiled from many thousands of repairs, the information found in the appropriate one will likely aid you in making a correct diagnosis. \nTake care to locate the cylinder which is misfiring. Once this is accomplished, you must pinpoint the exact cause of the malfunction. You may spend many hours in testing individual components but I have a simple system to accomplish this task. The procedure described is for a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission. Manual transmission equipped vehicles can also be tested this way but it is more challenging.\nIt is as follows:\n\n Determine within what RPM range the misfire most often occurs. This may be done by test driving or checking freeze frame data\nWith the RPM range determined, start the engine and allow it to reach normal operating temperature\nPlace a chock on both sides of the drive wheels of the vehicle\nHave an assistant get into the driver\u2019s seat and place the shifter in DRIVE with the parking brake set and their foot firmly pressing down on the brake pedal\nTake up a position alongside the front of the vehicle, so that you can reach the engine, with the hood open and secure\nHave the assistant gradually increase the RPM level by pressing the accelerator pedal until the misfire is exhibited\nWith the engine misfiring, CAREFULLY lift the ignition coil from its perch and note the degree of high-intensity spark being produced\nHigh-intensity spark should be bright blue in color and stunning in intensity. If it is not, suspect a defective ignition coil\nIf you are unsure about the level of spark produced by the coil in question, lift a known working coil from its perch and observe the degree of spark\nReplacement of the corresponding spark plug and boot/wire is recommended if the ignition coil must be replaced\nIf the ignition coil seems to be firing normally, turn the engine off and insert a known good spark plug in the boot/wire\nRestart the engine and have the assistant repeat the procedure\nObserve high-intensity spark across the spark plug. It should also be bright blue and intense in nature. If it is not, suspect a defective spark plug for the cylinder in question\nIf high-intensity spark (for the affected cylinder) seems normal, you may perform a similar test for the fuel injector by carefully disconnecting it to see if any difference in engine RPM is detected. A working fuel injector will also emit an audible ticking sound\nIf the fuel injector is inoperative, use a node light to test for voltage and a ground signal (at the injector connector) while the engine is running\n\nIn most cases, you will have found the cause of the misfire by the time you finish testing for high-intensity spark.\n\n EGR systems which use a system for injecting exhaust gases into individual cylinders are known to cause symptoms which simulate a misfire condition. The EGR cylinder portals clog and cause all of the EGR gases to be dumped into one cylinder, resulting in a misfire\nUse caution when testing high-intensity spark. 50,000-volts can be harmful or even fatal in extreme circumstances\nWhen testing high-intensity spark, keep it away from fuel sources to avoid catastrophe\n\nCylinder Misfire Video\nWe are not affiliated with the producers of this video.

    "Common Causes": "This code may also be triggered with another of the other misfire codes which are P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304, P0305, P0306, P0307, P0308, P0309, P0310, P0311, P0312. If you have another misfire trouble code also, you should diagnose and repair that code(s) first.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0316 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nRough engine start or idle\n\nPotential Causes\nPotential causes of this misfire code may include:\n\nDamaged or defective Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP)\nCKP sensor wiring or connector fault\nPoor fuel quality\nRan out of fuel\nIgnition system malfunction\nFuel system malfunction: injector or fuel pump\nMechanical engine problem\nDamaged PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nFirst off, you'll want to repair any other misfire DTC codes if present prior to diagnosing this code. If you own a Ford vehicle and you have a P0316 along with one of the other misfire codes, you should check for appropriate TSBs (technical service bulletins), as there are some TSBs that in part involve reprogramming the PCM. Doing that requires specialized equipment. Some Ford vehicles even needed a new cylinder head as a result of the valve. Regardless, if you have a Ford with multiple misfire codes including this one, check for TSBs.\nIf the P0316 is the only code, then it's time to do a bit more diagnosing of the crankshaft and camshaft position sensors, and their associated connectors and wiring. A tip we've found is \"Since this code indicates a start up misfire, pay attention to items which may expand or contract when cold (if the code sets when the engine is cold), or hot (if the code sets on a hot restart).\"\nRealistically, the freeze frame data from the PCM will be helpful in tracking down the problem. As will a good DVOM (digital volt-ohm meter), so you can perform tests on the wiring and the sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nFour codes (P0102, P0113, P0303, P0316 ), where to start?Hi to all,\nYesterday I scanned my wife's 2003 Mustang and go 4 codes: P0102, P0113, P0303 and P0316. \nWhere to start?

  "P0324": {
    "Meaning": "P0324 Knock Control System Error",
    "Common Causes": "The knock sensor control system typically consists of the knock sensor connector, wiring, and the PCM. The knock sensor is a piezoelectric sensor that is usually threaded directly into the engine block. The location of the sensor varies between manufacturers but most are either in the sides of the block (between water jacket freeze plugs) or underneath the intake manifold. Use caution when removing knock sensors that are in the sides of the engine block as they are often threaded directly into engine coolant passages.\nRemoval of these sensors, when the engine is warm and the engine cooling system is under pressure, could result in being burned by hot coolant. Before removing the knock sensor, allow the engine to cool sufficiently and drain the coolant into a suitable container for lawful disposal. \nThe key component of the knock sensor is a piezoelectric sensing crystal. When shaken, or vibrated in this case, the piezoelectric crystal produces a small amount of voltage. Since the knock sensor control circuit is normally a one-wire ground circuit, the voltage generated by the inadvertent vibration is recognized by the PCM as engine knock or ping. The level of voltage produced is dependent on the severity of the vibration encountered by the piezoelectric crystal inside the knock sensor.\nKnock sensor control systems are usually arranged with a knock sensor for each engine bank but some manufacturers use as many as one knock sensor per cylinder. Consult a reliable vehicle information source for the configuration of the knock sensor control system for the vehicle in question.\nIf the PCM detects a level of knock sensor voltage that indicates a spark detonation; it could retard ignition timing to prevent engine damage and no knock sensor control code may be stored (unless it is very severe). If the PCM detects a level of knock sensor voltage that is indicative of a more severe engine noise (such as a connecting rod contacting the inside of the engine block), it may discontinue fuel delivery and ignition spark to the affected cylinder and a knock sensor code will be stored. \nThere is almost always a very small amount of voltage produced by the knock sensor when the engine is running. This is because no matter how smooth an engine runs, a slight amount of vibration is inevitable. If the PCM detects an unexpected signal from the knock sensor, like battery voltage, complete battery ground, or pulsing voltage, a code P0324 will be stored and a MIL may be illuminated.\nRelated knock sensor / circuit trouble codes include P0325, P0326, P0327, P0328, P0329, P0330, P0331, P0332, P0333, and P0334.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nA stored code P0324 could be a sign of severe internal engine failure. For this cause, it must be addressed with some degree of urgency.\nSymptoms of this code may include:\n Diminished engine performance\nHesitation upon acceleration\nLoud noises from the engine area\nDecreased fuel efficiency\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Defective knock sensor/s\nInternal engine malfunction\nIgnition misfire/s\nContaminated or substandard fuel\nDefective knock sensor control wiring and/or connectors\nBad PCM or a PCM programing error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter, and a reliable vehicle information source will be necessary to diagnose a code P0324.\nIf the engine is knocking, or excessively noisy in any way, address that before attempting a diagnosis for any knock sensor codes. \nConsult your vehicle information source for technical service bulletins (TSB) which match the symptom/s exhibited and the code/s stored in the vehicle in question. If the problem that you are having is a common one; the correct TSB may aid in a successful diagnosis. Follow the diagnostic steps found therein and you will likely arrive at a successful diagnosis. \nBegin with a visual inspection of all system related wiring harnesses and connectors. Look for burnt, corroded, or otherwise broken wiring and connectors that may create an open circuit and repair them. Some vehicle manufacturers place the knock sensor in the lower part of the engine block. This may make it susceptible to damage when heavy parts (like starters and engine mounts) are replaced. System connectors, wiring, and fragile knock sensors are frequently broken when repairs are made in the vicinity. If no discrepancies are observed, continue to the next step.\nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Record this information for use in the ensuing diagnostic process. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if the code is reset.\nIf the code is reset, start the engine and use the scanner to observe knock sensor data. If scanner indicates that knock sensor voltage is not within manufacturer\u2019s specifications, use the DVOM to test live data at the knock sensor connector. If the signal at the connector is within specs, suspect a wiring problem between the sensor and the PCM. If voltage at the knock sensor connector is not within specifications, suspect a defective knock sensor.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n Knock sensor controller codes are usually confined to wiring, connectors, and controllers\nBeware of knock sensors that are threaded into engine coolant passages \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nC180 mercedes P0324 knock control system errorP0324 knock control system error on my C180 mercedes, knock sensor changed and same thing happened.

If your knock \n    sensor wasn't operating properly, so that it was always indicating a knock, \n  the engine computer's response may have been to change the ignition timing on \n  your engine to help prevent damage. \nKnock sensors generally bolt \n  into or thread into the engine block. This P0325 code may show \n  up intermittently or the Service Engine light may be lit constantly. Other knock sensor related DTC codes include P0330.\nHere is an example of a typical knock sensor:\n\nWhat are the symptoms of a bad knock sensor?\nPotential symptoms of a bad knock sensor and/or a P0325 code may include:\n\nilluminated Check Engine Light (malfunction indicator lamp)\nlack of power\nengine hesitation\nengine detonation\nan audible pinging noise from the engine, especially while accelerating or under load\ndecreased fuel efficiency (increased consumption)\n\nWhat Causes a P0325 Code?\nA code P0325 most likely means one or more of the following \n  has happened:\n\nThe knock sensor is faulty and needs to \n    be replaced\nThere is a wiring short/fault in the knock \n    sensor circuit\nThe PCM powertrain control module is failed\n\nPossible Solutions\n\nCheck the resistance of the knock sensor \n    (compare it to factory specs)\nCheck for broken/frayed wires leading to the sensor\nCheck for continuity in the wiring from the PCM to the knock sensor wiring connector\nReplace the knock sensor\n\nTIP: It may be helpful to use a scan tool to read the freeze frame data. That is a snapshot of the various sensors and conditions when the code was set. This information could be helpful for diagnosis.\nWe hope you've found this P0325 information helpful.

  "P0326": {
    "Meaning": "P0326 Knock Sensor Circuit Range Performance",
    "Common Causes": "The sensor signal wire informs the PCM when a knock occurs and in what degree of severity. The PCM will retard the spark timing to avoid pre-detonation. Most PCMs have the ability to learn spark knock trends in the engine during normal operation.\nIf the PCM determines that the knock is out of the ordinary or that the noise level is abnormally high, P0326 may set. If the PCM senses that the knock is severe and cannot be eliminated by retarding the spark timing, P0326 may set. Keep in mind that knock sensors cannot distinguish between a knock from pre-detonation or one from engine problems. \nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0326 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nAudible knocking from the engine compartment\nPinging from engine under acceleration\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0326 code include:\n\nKnock sensor connector is damaged\nKnock sensor circuit is open or shorted to ground\nKnock sensor circuit is shorted to voltage\nKnock sensor has failed\nMoisture in knock sensor connectors\nIncorrect fuel octane\nPCM has failed\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf an engine knock can be heard, fix the source of the mechanical problem first then retest. Make sure the proper octane of fuel was used in the engine. Using lower octane fuel than what is specified can cause a ping or pre-detonation and may cause P0326.\nUnplug the knock sensor and check for water or corrosion in the connector. If the knock sensor has a seal, verify there is no coolant from the engine block fouling the sensor. Repair as necessary.\nTurn ignition to run position with engine off. Ensure that 5 Volts are present at the KS connector. If there is, check for proper resistance between KS terminal and engine ground. You will need a vehicle specification for this. If resistance is out of specification, replace the knock sensor. If resistance is normal, plug KS back in and idle the engine. Using a scan tool in datastream, observe KS value. Does it indicate a knock is present at idle? If so, replace the knock sensor. If the knock sensor shows no knock at idle, then tap on the engine block while observing the knock signal. If it doesn't show a signal that corresponds with the taps, replace the knock sensor. If it does, verify the knock sensor wiring isn't routed next to ignition wires. If there was no 5 volts present at the knock sensor connector while unplugged with KOEO (Key on engine off) then go back to the PCM connector. Turn ignition off and clip the knock sensor 5 volt reference wire in a location that is easy to repair (Or remove the wire from the PCM connector). With KOEO, check for 5 volts on the PCM side of the clipped wire. If 5 volts isn't present, suspect a bad PCM. If 5 volts IS present, repair short in 5 volt reference circuit.\nSince the reference circuit is a shared circuit, you will need to check all engine sensors that are fed a 5 volt reference. Unplug each sensor one at a time until the reference voltage returns. When it returns the last sensor you plugged in is the shorted sensor. If no sensors are shorted, check the wiring harness for short to voltage on reference circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nHuyandai Accent code P0326 2012 near 65000 miles automaticHello, great website and members.

Most PCMs have the ability to learn spark knock trends in the engine during normal operation.\nA P0328 code is a generic DTC, thus it applies to all makes of vehicles, and refers to a high output voltage of the knock sensor. In many cases, this means the voltage is above 4.5V but that specific value depends on the specific make and model of vehicle.

Ensure the correct octane fuel was used (some engines require premium fuel, check the owners manual). Aside from that, for this code, most likely the problem will lie either with the knock sensor itself or the wiring & connectors going from the sensor to the PCM.\nRealisitcally, for the DIY vehicle owner, the best next steps are to measure the resistance between the two knock sensor wire terminals where they go into the PCM. Also, check the voltage of the same terminals. Compare those numbers to the manufacturer's specifications. Also, check all wiring and connectors leading from the knock sensor back to the PCM. In addition, you should also check the resistance using a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM) of the knock sensor itself, compare it to the vehicle manufacturers specification.

  "P0329": {
    "Meaning": "P0329 Knock Sensor Circuit Intermittent",
    "Common Causes": "Typically threaded directly into the engine block, the knock sensor is a piezoelectric sensor. The location of the sensors in a multi-sensor system may vary between manufacturers but most are in the sides of the block (between water jacket freeze plugs). Knock sensors that are in the sides of the engine block are often threaded directly into engine coolant passages. When the engine is warm and the engine cooling system is under pressure, removal of these sensors could result in severe burns from hot coolant. Before removing any knock sensor/s, allow the engine to cool and always dispose of coolant properly. \nA piezoelectric sensing crystal is at the heart of the knock sensor. When shaken or vibrated, the piezoelectric crystal produces a small amount of voltage. Since the knock sensor control circuit is normally a one-wire ground circuit, the voltage generated by the vibration is recognized by the PCM as engine noise or vibration. The severity of the vibration encountered by the piezoelectric crystal (inside the knock sensor) determines the level of voltage produced in the circuit.\nIf the PCM detects a degree of knock sensor voltage indicative of a spark detonation; it may retard ignition timing and no knock sensor control code may be stored. If the PCM detects a level of knock sensor voltage that indicates a more severe engine noise (such as a connecting rod contacting the inside of the engine block), it may discontinue fuel delivery and ignition spark to the affected cylinder and a knock sensor code will be stored. \nA very small amount of voltage is always produced by the knock sensor when the engine is running. This is because a slight amount of vibration is inevitable, no matter how smoothly an engine runs. If the PCM detects an unexpected signal from knock sensor 1, like battery voltage, complete battery ground, or pulsing voltage, a code P0329 will be stored and a MIL may be illuminated.\nRelated knock sensor / circuit trouble codes include P0324, P0325, P0326, P0327, P0328, P0330, P0331, P0332,  P0333, and P0334.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nA stored code P0329 could be a sign of severe internal engine failure. For this cause, it must be addressed with some degree of urgency.\nSymptoms of this code may include:\n Diminished engine performance\nHesitation upon acceleration\nLoud noises from the engine area\nDecreased fuel efficiency\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Defective knock sensor/s\nInternal engine malfunction\nIgnition misfire/s\nContaminated or substandard fuel\nDefective knock sensor control wiring and/or connectors\nBad PCM or a PCM programing error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nTo diagnose a code P0329, a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter, and a reliable vehicle information source will be necessary. If the engine sounds like it is knocking, or excessively noisy, address that issue before attempting a diagnosis for any knock sensor codes. \nConsult your vehicle information source for technical service bulletins (TSB) which coincide with the symptom/s exhibited and the code/s stored in the vehicle in question. If the problem which you are having is a common one; the correct TSB may help form a successful diagnosis. Follow the diagnostic steps found in the TSB and you will likely arrive at the correct solution. \nI like to start with a visual inspection of all system related wiring harnesses and connectors. I am searching for burnt, corroded, or otherwise broken wiring and connectors that may create an open or shorted circuit. Knock sensors are often in the lower part of the engine block. This makes them susceptible to damage when heavy parts (like starters and engine mounts) are replaced. System connectors, wiring, and fragile knock sensors are frequently broken during repairs in the vicinity. \nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Write this information down for use in the diagnostic process. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if any are reset.\nIf the P0329 is reset, start the engine and use the scanner to observe knock sensor data. If the scanner indicates that knock sensor voltage is not within manufacturer\u2019s specifications, use the DVOM to test live data at the knock sensor connector. If the signal at the connector is within specs, suspect a wiring issue between the sensor and the PCM. If voltage at the knock sensor connector is not within specifications, suspect a defective knock sensor.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n Systems with multiple knock sensors are arranged differently from one vehicle to another. Be careful to address the correct knock sensor for the code exhibited\nBeware of hot, pressurized coolant when removing knock sensors that are threaded into engine coolant passages \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n97 Sunfire P0329Recently purchased a 97 Pontiac Sunfire with 125,000 miles on the clock.

  "P0331": {
    "Meaning": "P0331 Knock Sensor 2 Circuit Range/Performance",
    "Common Causes": "If the PCM determines that the knock is out of the ordinary or that the noise level is abnormally high, P0331 may set. If the PCM senses that the knock is severe and cannot be eliminated by retarding the spark timing, P0331 may set. Keep in mind that knock sensors cannot distinguish between a knock from pre-detonation or one from engine problems. Bank 2 is the side of the engine that doesn't contain cylinder #1.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0331 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nAudible knocking from the engine compartment\nPinging from engine under acceleration\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0331 code include:\n\nKnock sensor (KS) connector is damaged\nKnock sensor circuit is open or shorted to ground\nKnock sensor circuit is shorted to voltage\nKnock sensor has failed\nMoisture in knock sensor connectors\nIncorrect fuel octane\nPCM has failed\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf an engine knock can be heard, fix the source of the mechanical problem first then retest. Make sure the proper octane of fuel was used in the engine. Using lower octane fuel than what is specified can cause a ping or pre-detonation and may cause P0331.\nUnplug the knock sensor and check for water or corrosion in the connector. If the knock sensor has a seal, verify there is no coolant from the engine block fouling the sensor. Repair as necessary.\nTurn ignition to run position with engine off. Ensure that 5 Volts are present at the KS connector. If there is, check for proper resistance between KS terminal and engine ground. You will need a vehicle specification for this. If resistance is out of specification, replace the knock sensor. If resistance is normal, plug KS back in and idle the engine. Using a scan tool in datastream, observe KS value. Does it indicate a knock is present at idle? If so, replace the knock sensor. If the knock sensor shows no knock at idle, then tap on the engine block while observing the knock signal. If it doesn't show a signal that corresponds with the taps, replace the knock sensor. If it does, verify the knock sensor wiring isn't routed next to ignition wires. If there was no 5 volts present at the knock sensor connector while unplugged with KOEO (Key on engine off) then go back to the PCM connector. Turn ignition off and clip the knock sensor 5 volt reference wire in a location that is easy to repair (Or remove the wire from the PCM connector). With KOEO, check for 5 volts on the PCM side of the clipped wire. If 5 volts isn't present, suspect a bad PCM. If 5 volts IS present, repair short in 5 volt reference circuit.\nSince the reference circuit is a shared circuit, you will need to check all engine sensors that are fed a 5 volt reference. Unplug each sensor one at a time until the reference voltage returns. When it returns the last sensor you plugged in is the shorted sensor.

  "P0333": {
    "Meaning": "P0333 Knock Sensor 2 Circuit High Input",
    "Common Causes": "The knock sensor (KS) is usually a two wire sensor. A 5 volt reference is supplied to the sensor and there is a signal return from the knock sensor to the PCM (powertrain control module). The sensor signal wire informs the PCM when a knock occurs and in what degree of severity. The PCM will retard the spark timing to avoid pre-detonation. Most PCMs have the ability to learn spark knock trends in the engine during normal operation.\nA P0333 code is a generic DTC, thus it applies to all makes of vehicles, and refers to a high output voltage of the knock sensor. In many cases, this means the voltage is above 4.5V but that specific value depends on the specific make and model of vehicle. This code refers to the sensor on bank #2 (the side of the engine that doesn't contain cylinder #1).\n\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0333 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nAudible knocking from the engine compartment\nPinging from engine under acceleration\nLoss of power\nIrregular RPM\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0333 code include:\n\nKnock sensor connector is damaged\nKnock sensor circuit is open or shorted to ground\nKnock sensor circuit is shorted to voltage\nKnock sensor has failed\nLoose knock sensor\nElectrical interference in circuit\nLow fuel pressure\nIncorrect fuel octane\nMechanical engine problem\nFailed/faulty PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\nIf you can hear engine knock (detonation), first fix the source of the mechanical problem and retest. Ensure the correct octane fuel was used (some engines require premium fuel, check the owners manual). Aside from that, for this code, most likely the problem will lie either with the knock sensor itself or the wiring & connectors going from the sensor to the PCM.\nRealisitcally, for the DIY vehicle owner, the best next steps are to measure the resistance between the two knock sensor wire terminals where they go into the PCM. Also, check the voltage of the same terminals. Compare those numbers to the manufacturer's specifications. Also, check all wiring and connectors leading from the knock sensor back to the PCM. In addition, you should also check the resistance using a Digital Volt Ohm Meter (DVOM) of the knock sensor itself, compare it to the vehicle manufacturers specification. If the knock sensor resistance value is out of spec, then it needs to be replaced.\nOther knock sensor DTCs include P0324, P0325, P0326, P0327, P0329, P0330, P0331, P0332, P0333, P0334\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2005 Toyota Hilux knock sensor p0333I have a 2005 toyota hilux v6 model, the engine light is on.

  "P0334": {
    "Meaning": "P0334 Knock Sensor 2 Circuit Intermittent (Bank 2)",
    "Common Causes": "Typically threaded directly into the engine block, the knock sensor is a piezoelectric sensor. The location of the sensors in a multi-sensor system may vary between manufacturers but most are in the sides of the block (between water jacket freeze plugs). Knock sensors that are in the sides of the engine block are often threaded directly into engine coolant passages. When the engine is warm and the engine cooling system is under pressure, removal of these sensors could result in severe burns from hot coolant. Before removing any knock sensor/s, allow the engine to cool and always dispose of coolant properly. \nA piezoelectric sensing crystal is at the heart of the knock sensor. When shaken or vibrated, the piezoelectric crystal produces a small amount of voltage. Since the knock sensor control circuit is normally a one-wire ground circuit, the voltage generated by the vibration is recognized by the PCM as engine noise or vibration. The severity of the vibration encountered by the piezoelectric crystal (inside the knock sensor) determines the level of voltage produced in the circuit.\nIf the PCM detects a degree of knock sensor voltage indicative of a spark detonation; it may retard ignition timing and no knock sensor control code may be stored. If the PCM detects a level of knock sensor voltage that indicates a more severe engine noise (such as a connecting rod contacting the inside of the engine block), it may discontinue fuel delivery and ignition spark to the affected cylinder and a knock sensor code will be stored. \nA very small amount of voltage is always produced by the knock sensor when the engine is running. This is because a slight amount of vibration is inevitable, no matter how smoothly an engine runs. If the PCM detects an unexpected signal from knock sensor 2, like battery voltage, complete battery ground, or pulsing voltage, a code P0334 will be stored and a MIL may be illuminated.\nRelated knock sensor / circuit trouble codes include P0324, P0325, P0326, P0327, P0328, P0329, P0330, P0331, P0332, and P0333.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nA stored code P0334 could be a sign of severe internal engine failure. For this cause, it must be addressed with some degree of urgency.\nSymptoms of this code may include:\n Diminished engine performance\nHesitation upon acceleration\nLoud noises from the engine area\nDecreased fuel efficiency\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Defective knock sensor/s\nInternal engine malfunction\nIgnition misfire/s\nContaminated or substandard fuel\nDefective knock sensor control wiring and/or connectors\nBad PCM or a PCM programing error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nTo diagnose a code P0334, a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter, and a reliable vehicle information source will be necessary. If the engine sounds like it is knocking, or excessively noisy, address that issue before attempting a diagnosis for any knock sensor codes. \nConsult your vehicle information source for technical service bulletins (TSB) which coincide with the symptom/s exhibited and the code/s stored in the vehicle in question. If the problem which you are having is a common one; the correct TSB may help form a successful diagnosis. Follow the diagnostic steps found in the TSB and you will likely arrive at the correct solution. \nI like to start with a visual inspection of all system related wiring harnesses and connectors. I am searching for burnt, corroded, or otherwise broken wiring and connectors that may create an open or shorted circuit. Knock sensors are often in the lower part of the engine block. This makes them susceptible to damage when heavy parts (like starters and engine mounts) are replaced. System connectors, wiring, and fragile knock sensors are frequently broken during repairs in the vicinity. \nConnect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector and retrieve all stored codes and freeze frame data. Write this information down for use in the diagnostic process. Clear the codes and test drive the vehicle to see if any are reset.\nIf the P0334 is reset, start the engine and use the scanner to observe knock sensor data. If the scanner indicates that knock sensor voltage is not within manufacturer\u2019s specifications, use the DVOM to test live data at the knock sensor connector. If the signal at the connector is within specs, suspect a wiring issue between the sensor and the PCM. If voltage at the knock sensor connector is not within specifications, suspect a defective knock sensor.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n Systems with multiple knock sensors are arranged differently from one vehicle to another. Be careful to address the correct knock sensor for the code exhibited\nBeware of hot, pressurized coolant when removing knock sensors that are threaded into engine coolant passages \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.

  "P0336": {
    "Meaning": "P0336 Crankshaft Position Sensor Range/Performance",
    "Common Causes": "The crankshaft position sensor (CKP) is usually a two wire sensor: a signal and a ground. The CKP sensor consists of (usually) a permanent magnent sensor that is mounted in front of a reluctor (toothed) wheel mounted to the crankshaft.\nAs the reluctor wheel passes in front of the crank sensor, an A/C signal is produced that varies according to engine speed. The PCM (powertrain control module) uses this A/C signal to interpret engine RPM. Some crank sensors are hall-effect sensors instead of permanent magnent sensors. These are three wire sensors, provided with voltage, ground, and signal. They too have a reluctor wheel with vanes and \"windows\" that change the voltage signal to the PCM, providing a RPM signal. I will focus on the former, since they are simpler design and more common.\nThe crankshaft reluctor has a specific number of teeth and the PCM can determine the position of the crankshaft using only this sensor's signature pattern. The PCM uses this sensor to also determine cylinder misfires by measuring the reluctor teeth locations in the CKP sensor signal. In conjunction with the Camshaft position sensor (CMP) the PCM can determine timing of spark and fuel injection. If the PCM senses a loss of CKP sensor signal (RPM signal) even momentarily, P0336 may set.\nRelated crank position sensor trouble codes:\n\nP0335 Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Malfunction\nP0337 Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Low Input\nP0338 Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit High Input\nP0339 Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Intermittent\n\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0336 DTC may include:\n\nIntermittent stalling & no start\nNo start\nMIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) illumination\nIntermittent misfire\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0336 code include:\n\nBad crank sensor\nBroken reluctor ring (missing teeth, debris lodged in ring)\nReluctor ring dislodged/stripped from it's stationary location\nWiring harness chafing causing short\nWiring open in CKP circuit\n\nPossible Solutions\nCrankshaft sensor problems are at times intermittent and the vehicle may start and run for some time until problem occurs. Try to reproduce the complaint. When engine stalls or if the engine will not start and continue to run, then crank engine while observing RPM reading. If there is no RPM reading, check for a signal coming out of the crank sensor. Using a scope is best, but since most DIYers don't have access to one you may be able to use a code reader or the tachometer to check for RPM signal.\nVisually check the CKP harness for damage or cracking in the wiring insulation. Repair as necessary. Make sure the wiring isn't mis-routed near high voltage spark plug wires. Check for loose connection or broken lock at the sensor connector. Repair as necessary. Obtain a resistance spec for the Crank sensor. Remove and check it. If it doesn't pass, replace it. If it checks out okay, check the reluctor ring for damage, broken teeth, or debris lodged in the ring. Make sure the reluctor ring isn't dislodged. It should be stationary on the crankshaft. Carefully repair/replace as necessary. Note: some reluctor rings are located in the bell housing of the transmission or behind the front engine cover and cannot be easily accessed.\nIf the vehicle intermittently stalls and after stalling you have no RPM signal and you have verified the wiring to the CKP sensor is good, then try replacing the sensor. If that doesn't take care of it, and you can't access the reluctor ring, seek help from an automotive professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nNeed help Honda Civic P0336I have a 2003 Civic LX 1.7l engine.

  "P0337": {
    "Meaning": "P0337 Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Low",
    "Common Causes": "CKP sensors are responsible for monitoring engine speed (RPM) and crankshaft position. Both of these factors are used in various engine management scenarios but are especially critical to ignition (spark) timing and fuel delivery.\nThe position of the crankshaft, particularly in relation to the camshaft/s, is one of the key factors used by the PCM to calculate ignition spark timing. The camshafts turn at half the speed of the crankshaft, so it is important that the PCM is able to distinguish between engine intake and exhaust stokes (rotations). The CKP sensor and each camshaft position (CMP) sensor have at least one circuit dedicated to providing the PCM with an input signal, a 5-volt reference signal, and a ground. \nCKP sensors are typically of the electro magnetic, hall-effect variety. They are mounted to the exterior of the engine in very close proximity (usually only several thousandths of an inch) to a circuit completing engine ground. This engine ground is usually a reluctor ring (with precisely machined teeth) affixed to one end of the crankshaft or integrated into the crankshaft itself.\nThe CKP sensor is mounted so that the crankshaft reluctor wheel passes very closely to its magnetic tip. As the crankshaft rotates, the raised areas (on the reluctor wheel) complete an electromagnetic circuit with the sensor. When the gaps between the teeth pass the CKP sensor, the circuit is briefly interrupted. The circuit interruptions create voltage fluctuations that the PCM perceives as a waveform pattern. \nWith the engine running, the PCM constantly compares input signals from the CKP and CMP sensors. If CKP input signal voltage is lower than expected under certain circumstances, a P0337 code will be stored and a MIL may be illuminated.\nOther crankshaft position sensor trouble codes include P0335, P0336, P0338, and P0339.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nWhen a P0337 is stored, the engine will not likely run and this code should be categorized as severe. Even if the engine will start and run, there is a high risk of a no start condition and there will be drivability repercussions. \nSymptoms of this code may include:\n The engine will not start\nThe tachometer (if equipped) does not register RPM when the engine is cranked\nHesitation upon acceleration\nPoor engine performance\nDiminished fuel efficiency\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Defective CKP sensor\nOpen or shorted wiring to the CKP sensor\nCorroded or fluid soaked connector at the CKP sensor\nFaulty PCM or PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nPrior to diagnosing a code P0337, I need to have access to a suitable diagnostic scanner, with an integrated digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM) and oscilloscope. I will also need access to All Data DIY (as a reliable vehicle information source).\nA viable starting point for any code diagnosis is a visual inspection of system related wiring harnesses and connectors. Since petroleum based fluids compromise the protective insulation on wiring and lead to shorted or open circuits (and a stored P0337), circuits, electrical sensors, and/or connectors that have been contaminated with engine oil, coolant, or power steering fluid should be examined carefully. \nIf everything looks good, connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored trouble codes and freeze frame data. I like writing this information down as it may help if the P0337 proves to be intermittent. \nTest voltage at the CKP sensor in question. A five-volt reference is typically used for CKP sensor operation but check manufacturer\u2019s specifications for the vehicle in question. There should also be a ground signal and one or more output circuits. If reference voltage and ground circuits are detected at the CKP sensor connector, proceed to the next step.\nAfter disconnecting the electrical connector from the CKP sensor in question, test it according to manufacturer\u2019s specifications, using the DVOM. If resistance levels in the CKP sensor fail to comply with manufacturer\u2019s specifications, replace it. If the CKP sensor does coincide with specs, continue to the next step. Reconnect the CKP sensor in question. Attach the positive test lead of the oscilloscope to the signal output wire and connect the negative lead to the sensor ground circuit. Now, power up the oscilloscope and select the appropriate voltage setting. With the engine running, observe the waveform pattern on the oscilloscope focusing on unexpected spikes or glitches. If spikes or glitches are observed, carefully wiggle the wiring harness and connector for the CKP sensor in question to determine whether the problem is a loose connection or a defective sensor. If missing voltage blocks are noticed in the waveform pattern, suspect either a broken or worn reluctor ring or that the magnetic tip of the CKP sensor has excessive metallic debris. If no problems are found in the waveform pattern, proceed to the next step.\nConnect the test leads of the oscilloscope to CKP sensor signal input and ground circuits near the PCM connector and observe the waveform pattern. If the waveform pattern near the PCM connector is dissimilar to what was seen when the test leads were connected near the CKP sensor, suspect an open or shorted circuit between the CKP sensor connector and the PCM connector. If this is the case, disconnect all related controllers and begin testing individual circuits with the DVOM. Shorted or open circuits must be repaired or replaced. If the waveform pattern is identical to what was seen when the test leads were connected near the CKP sensor, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n Some manufacturers recommend that CKP and CMP sensors are replaced as a set\nUse technical service bulletins to aid in the diagnostic process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n1996 Chevy Z-71 P0337Truck turns over all day long, wont start.

  "P0338": {
    "Meaning": "P0338 Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit High Input",
    "Common Causes": "CKP sensors monitor engine speed (RPM) and crankshaft position. The position of the crankshaft is used by the PCM to calculate ignition spark timing. The camshafts turn at half the speed of the crankshaft, so it is important that the PCM is able to distinguish between engine intake and exhaust stokes (rotations). The CKP sensor and each camshaft position (CMP) sensor have one or more circuits dedicated to providing the PCM with an input signal, a 5-volt reference signal, and a ground. \nCKP sensors are typically of the electro magnetic, hall-effect variety and are mounted to the exterior of the engine. They are placed in very close proximity (usually only several thousandths of an inch) to a circuit completing engine ground. This engine ground is usually a reluctor ring (with precisely machined teeth) affixed to either end of the crankshaft or integrated into the crankshaft itself. Systems with multiple CMP sensors may use a reluctor ring on one end of the crankshaft and another machined into the center of the crankshaft.\nTypically, the CKP sensor is mounted so that the crankshaft reluctor ring passes within several thousandths of an inch of its magnetic tip. As the crankshaft rotates, raised areas of the reluctor ring complete an electromagnetic circuit with the sensor. The indentations (between the raised areas) interrupt the circuit briefly. The PCM perceives these rapid circuit completions and interruptions as a waveform pattern representing voltage fluctuations. \nThe PCM constantly compares input signals from the crankshaft position and camshaft position sensor circuits. If CKP input voltage is too high over a set period of time, a P0338 code will be stored and a MIL may be illuminated.\nOther crankshaft position sensor trouble codes include P0335, P0336, P0337, and P0339.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nWhen a P0338 is stored, a no-start condition will likely accompany it.

NOTE: this code can also be set by extended cranking periods.\nSymptoms\nThe car will likely run with this code set, as it is often intermittent and \n  also because the PCM can often operate the vehicle in \"limp-in/limp-home\" \n  mode even with a cam sensor signal problem. There may be no noticeable symptoms \n  other than:\n\n Poor fuel economy (if engine runs)\nPossible no start condition \n\nCauses\nA code P0341 may mean that one or more of the following has happened:\n\n Cam sensor wiring routed too close to spark plug wiring (causing interference)\n Poor wiring connection at cam sensor\n Poor wiring connection at PCM\n Bad cam sensor\n Damaged reluctor wheel\n\nPossible Solutions\nNOTE: In some cases this engine code is generated on vehicles that do not actually have a camshaft position sensor. In those cases it basically means the engine is misfiring badly due to faulty spark plugs, spark plug wires, and often coils.\nOften relacing the sensor fixes this code, but not necessarily. Therefore it's \n  important to check the following:\n\nCheck that the wiring isn't routed too close to any secondary ignition components \n    (coil, spark plug wires, etc.)\n Visually inspect the wiring at the sensor for any burn marks, discoloration \n    indicative of melting or chafing\n Visually inspect the cam sensor for damage\n Visually inspect the reluctor wheel through the cam sensor port (if possible) \n    for any missing teeth or any damage\n If reluctor isn't visible from outside the engine, visual test can only \n    be done by removing cam shaft or intake manifold (depending on engine design)\n If all checks out okay, then replace the sensor.\n\nRelated Camshaft Trouble Codes: P0340, P0342, P0343, P0345, P0347, P0348, P0349, P0365, P0366, P0367, P0368, P0369, P0390, P0391, P0392, P0393, P0394.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2004 Monte, No Cam signal, Code P0341 but starts and runs...Long story short the cam sensor wires were pinched and shorted by the power steering pump on a 3.4L.

  "P0350": {
    "Meaning": "P0350 Ignition Coil Primary/Secondary Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "Most OBD-II equipped vehicles utilize a coil-over-plug, distributor less ignition system. In this type of system, each cylinder is outfitted with its own ignition coil which is attached to the spark plug using a short plug wire or silicon boot. Battery voltage, and a ground pulse from the PCM applied to a tightly wound induction coil, create the high-intensity spark (thousands of volts) that is required to fire the spark plug for each cylinder. \nSystems which use coil packs function in a similar manner, except multiple spark plugs are fired from a coil pack which fires multiple cylinders in sequential order. This type of system typically uses longer high tension spark plug leads to transfer the high-intensity spark from the coil pack towers to the spark plugs. \nRegardless of the type of ignition system with which the vehicle in question is equipped, spark timing and function are controlled by the PCM. Provided with a constant supply of switched battery voltage (with the ignition switch on), the ignition coil releases a high-intensity spark when it receives a ground pulse from the PCM. \nIf the PCM detects that any of the ignition coil circuits are not being completed when the ground pulse is applied, a code P0350 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may be illuminated.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nIgnition misfire issues will likely accompany a code P0350; therefore it should be categorized as severe.\nSymptoms of this code may include:\n Drivability issues, including one or more ignition misfires\nPoor engine performance\nDiminished fuel efficiency\nCylinder misfire codes will likely accompany a code P0350 (e.g. P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304, etc.)\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Open or shorted primary/secondary circuits\nDefective ignition coils or coil pack/s\nBad ignition system relay\nBlown fuses or fusible links\nFaulty PCM or a PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nIn order to diagnose a code P0350, I would need a diagnostic scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reliable vehicle information source, such as ALL DATA (DIY).\nA visual inspection of all ignition coil/pack wiring and connectors is the best place to begin your diagnosis of a code P0350. Be on the lookout for broken electrical connectors at the ignition coils or coil packs. Also check for wiring that is burned, broken, or corroded. I have personally found rodent damaged wiring to be the cause of a code P0350 in several customer cars. Ignition coil electrical connector ends are also known for becoming corroded over time.\nI would continue by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieving all the stored codes and freeze frame data. I have found it helpful to record this information for later. Next, I\u2019d clear the codes and test-drive the vehicle to see if the P0350 is reset.\nUse your vehicle information source to search technical service bulletins (TSB) that may help with your diagnosis. TSBs with matching symptoms and codes can prove very helpful if you use the diagnostic tips found therein.\nIf there are cylinder specific ignition coil primary /secondary circuit codes present, they may help you to pin point the defective circuit or coil/pack. If there are no cylinder specific codes present, you will need to find out which coil, coil pack, or circuit is malfunctioning. This can be done by testing the coils or coil packs for the correct level of Hertz when high-intensity spark is emitted but I use a simpler method. With the engine running and the parking brake set, I use an assistant to sit in the driver\u2019s seat. He presses the brake firmly to the floor, places the shifter in drive, and depresses the accelerator pedal slightly but gradually. When the engine begins to misfire, my assistant holds the accelerator pedal in that position, while I systematically remove each spark plug wire/boot from the spark plug (you can also unplug each coil pack electrical connector, if you\u2019d rather, to avoid the pitfalls of being subjected to more than 50,000-volts of high-intensity spark). \nWhen you discover a coil or coil pack tower that makes no difference in engine RPM when the plug wire/boot is removed from the spark plug; you have found the cylinder number of the coil/pack at fault. You will probably notice that the level of high-intensity spark emitted from the malfunctioning coil/pack is significantly less than those which are functioning properly. Be sure to clear codes after performing this test. Once you have located the coil/pack in question, use the DVOM to test for battery voltage at the coil/pack connector when the ignition is on. If there is no voltage present, use the vehicle information source to find the voltage source so that you may check blown fuses, defective relays, etc. Remember that blown fuses are a reaction to an electrical short and not the source of a malfunction. If all fuses and relays are good, use the DVOM to probe individual circuits for continuity and resistance. Disconnect all related controllers before doing this to prevent damage to the sensitive electronics found onboard. Repair or replace circuits which fail to comply with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (found in the vehicle information source).\nIf the voltage signal is present at the ignition coil/pack, test the coil connector for a ground pulse from the PCM. If no ground pulse is present (when the engine is cranked or running), suspect a defective driver in the PCM if no other ignition codes (including crankshaft position and camshaft position sensor codes) are present.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n A maintenance tune-up is NOT a fix for a code P0350\nUse caution when testing high-intensity spark in the vicinity of flammable liquids \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2004 Hyundai Sonata cause for code P0350I have a 2004 Hyundai Sonata and had some work done last week, I had the vale cover gasket replaced and spark plug and spark wires replaced.

    "Meaning": "P0351 Ignition Coil A Primary/Secondary Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "It eliminates the need for spark plug wires by putting the coil right above the sparkplug. Two wires are dedicated to each coil. One is a battery feed usually from the power distribution center. The other wire is the coil driver circuit from the PCM. The PCM grounds/ungrounds this circuit to activate or deactivate the coil. The coil driver circuit is monitored by the PCM for faults\n If an open or a short is detected in the driver circuit for coil number 1, a P0351 may set. Also, depending on the vehicle, the PCM may also shut down the fuel injector to the cylinder also.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0351 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nEngine misfire may be present or intermittent\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0351 code include:\n\nShort to voltage or ground on COP driver circuit\nOpen on COP driver circuit\nLoose connection at coil or broken connector locks\nBad Coil (COP)\nFaulty Powertrain Control Module\n\nPossible Solutions\nIs the engine misfiring presently? If not, the problem is likely intermittent. Try wiggle testing the wiring at the #1 coil and along the wiring harness to the PCM. If manipulating the wiring causes the misfire to surface, repair the wiring problem. Check for poor connection at the coil connector. Verify the harness isn't misrouted or chafing on anything. Repair as necessary\n If the engine is misfiring presently, stop the engine and disconnect the #1 coil wiring connector. Then start the engine and check for a driver signal to the #1 coil. Using a scope will give you a visual pattern to observe, but since most people don't have access to one there's an easier way. Use a Voltmeter in AC Hertz scale and see if there's a Hz reading of between 5 and 20 or so that indicates the driver is working. If there is a Hertz signal, then replace the #1 ignition coil. It's likely bad. If you don't detect any frequency signal from the PCM on the ignition coil driver circuit indicating the PCM is grounding/ungrounding the circuit (or there is no visible pattern on the scope if you have one) then leave the coil disconnected and check for DC voltage on the driver circuit at the ignition coil connector. If there is any significant voltage on that wire then there is a short to voltage somewhere. Find the short and repair it.\nIf there is no voltage on the driver circuit, then turn the ignition off. Disconnect the PCM connector and check the continuity of the driver between the PCM and the coil. If there is no continuity repair the open or short to ground in the circuit. If continuity is present, then check for resistance between ground and the ignition coil connector. There should be infinite resistance. If there isn't, repair the short to ground in the coil driver circuit\n NOTE: If the ignition coil driver signal wire is not open or shorted to voltage or ground and there is no trigger signal to the coil then suspect a faulty PCM coil driver. Also keep in mind that if the PCM driver is at fault, there may be a wiring problem that caused the PCM failure. It's a good idea to do the above check after PCM replacement to verify there won't be a repeat failure. If you find that the engine isn't misfiring, the coil is being triggered properly but P0351 is continually being reset, there is the possibility that the PCM coil monitoring system may be faulty.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2006 Taurus P0351 need help!I have an 06 Taurus with a vulcan 3.0L with about 120000 miles on it.

  "P0354": {
    "Meaning": "P0354 Ignition Coil D Primary/Secondary Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "It eliminates the need for spark plug wires by putting the coil right above the sparkplug. Two wires are dedicated to each coil. One is a battery feed usually from the power distribution center. The other wire is the coil driver circuit from the PCM. The PCM grounds/ungrounds this circuit to activate or deactivate the coil. The coil driver circuit is monitored by the PCM for faults\n If an open or a short is detected in the driver circuit for coil #4, a P0354 may set. Also, depending on the vehicle, the PCM may also shut down the fuel injector to the cylinder also.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0354 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nEngine misfire may be present or intermittent\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0354 code include:\n\nShort to voltage or ground on COP driver circuit\nOpen on COP driver circuit\nLoose connection at coil or broken connector locks\nBad Coil (COP)\nFaulty Powertrain Control Module\n\nPossible Solutions\nIs the engine misfiring presently? If not, the problem is likely intermittent. Try wiggle testing the wiring at the #4 coil and along the wiring harness to the PCM. If manipulating the wiring causes the misfire to surface, repair the wiring problem. Check for poor connection at the coil connector. Verify the harness isn't misrouted or chafing on anything. Repair as necessary\n If the engine is misfiring presently, stop the engine and disconnect the #4 coil wiring connector. Then start the engine and check for a driver signal to the #4 coil. Using a scope will give you a visual pattern to observe, but since most people don't have access to one there's an easier way. Use a Voltmeter in AC Hertz scale and see if there's a Hz reading of between 5 and 20 or so that indicates the driver is working. If there is a Hertz signal, then replace the #4 ignition coil. It's likely bad. If you don't detect any frequency signal from the PCM on the ignition coil driver circuit indicating the PCM is grounding/ungrounding the circuit (or there is no visible pattern on the scope if you have one) then leave the coil disconnected and check for DC voltage on the driver circuit at the ignition coil connector. If there is any significant voltage on that wire then there is a short to voltage somewhere. Find the short and repair it.\nIf there is no voltage on the driver circuit, then turn the ignition off. Disconnect the PCM connector and check the continuity of the driver between the PCM and the coil. If there is no continuity repair the open or short to ground in the circuit. If continuity is present, then check for resistance between ground and the ignition coil connector. There should be infinite resistance. If there isn't, repair the short to ground in the coil driver circuit\n NOTE: If the ignition coil driver signal wire is not open or shorted to voltage or ground and there is no trigger signal to the coil then suspect a faulty PCM coil driver. Also keep in mind that if the PCM driver is at fault, there may be a wiring problem that caused the PCM failure. It's a good idea to do the above check after PCM replacement to verify there won't be a repeat failure. If you find that the engine isn't misfiring, the coil is being triggered properly but P0354 is continually being reset, there is the possibility that the PCM coil monitoring system may be faulty.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2005 Lincoln Town Car Multiple Codes P0102 P0174 P0351 P0352 P0353 P0354 P2106 P2195 P0183 P01942005 Lincoln Town Car 4.6L engine having Coil On Plug (COP) ignition\n\nI'm getting misfire codes on the entire right (passenger) bank.

    "Meaning": "P0356 Ignition Coil F Primary/Secondary Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "It eliminates the need for spark plug wires by putting the coil right above the sparkplug. Two wires are dedicated to each coil. One is a battery feed usually from the power distribution center. The other wire is the coil driver circuit from the PCM. The PCM grounds/ungrounds this circuit to activate or deactivate the coil. The coil driver circuit is monitored by the PCM for faults\n If an open or a short is detected in the driver circuit for coil #6, a P0356 may set. Also, depending on the vehicle, the PCM may also shut down the fuel injector to the cylinder also.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a P0356 DTC may include:\n\nMIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination\nEngine misfire may be present or intermittent\n\nCauses\nPotential causes of a P0356 code include:\n\nShort to voltage or ground on COP driver circuit\nOpen on COP driver circuit\nLoose connection at coil or broken connector locks\nBad Coil (COP)\nFaulty Powertrain Control Module\n\nPossible Solutions\nIs the engine misfiring presently? If not, the problem is likely intermittent. Try wiggle testing the wiring at the #6 coil and along the wiring harness to the PCM. If manipulating the wiring causes the misfire to surface, repair the wiring problem. Check for poor connection at the coil connector. Verify the harness isn't misrouted or chafing on anything. Repair as necessary\n If the engine is misfiring presently, stop the engine and disconnect the #6 coil wiring connector. Then start the engine and check for a driver signal to the #6 coil. Using a scope will give you a visual pattern to observe, but since most people don't have access to one there's an easier way. Use a Voltmeter in AC Hertz scale and see if there's a Hz reading of between 5 and 20 or so that indicates the driver is working. If there is a Hertz signal, then replace the #6 ignition coil. It's likely bad. If you don't detect any frequency signal from the PCM on the ignition coil driver circuit indicating the PCM is grounding/ungrounding the circuit (or there is no visible pattern on the scope if you have one) then leave the coil disconnected and check for DC voltage on the driver circuit at the ignition coil connector. If there is any significant voltage on that wire then there is a short to voltage somewhere. Find the short and repair it.\nIf there is no voltage on the driver circuit, then turn the ignition off. Disconnect the PCM connector and check the continuity of the driver between the PCM and the coil. If there is no continuity repair the open or short to ground in the circuit. If continuity is present, then check for resistance between ground and the ignition coil connector. There should be infinite resistance. If there isn't, repair the short to ground in the coil driver circuit\n NOTE: If the ignition coil driver signal wire is not open or shorted to voltage or ground and there is no trigger signal to the coil then suspect a faulty PCM coil driver. Also keep in mind that if the PCM driver is at fault, there may be a wiring problem that caused the PCM failure. It's a good idea to do the above check after PCM replacement to verify there won't be a repeat failure. If you find that the engine isn't misfiring, the coil is being triggered properly but P0356 is continually being reset, there is the possibility that the PCM coil monitoring system may be faulty.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2004 F150 4.6 p0351 p0356 and p0506I have a 2004 Ford F-150 4.6 V8 I\u2019m getting 3 Code\u2019s po351.

Using a scope will give you a visual pattern to observe, but since most people don't have access to one there's an easier way. Use a Voltmeter in AC Hertz scale and see if there's a Hz reading of between 5 and 20 or so that indicates the driver is working. If there is a Hertz signal, then replace the #10 ignition coil. It's likely bad. If you don't detect any frequency signal from the PCM on the ignition coil driver circuit indicating the PCM is grounding/ungrounding the circuit (or there is no visible pattern on the scope if you have one) then leave the coil disconnected and check for DC voltage on the driver circuit at the ignition coil connector. If there is any significant voltage on that wire then there is a short to voltage somewhere. Find the short and repair it.\nIf there is no voltage on the driver circuit, then turn the ignition off. Disconnect the PCM connector and check the continuity of the driver between the PCM and the coil. If there is no continuity repair the open or short to ground in the circuit. If continuity is present, then check for resistance between ground and the ignition coil connector. There should be infinite resistance. If there isn't, repair the short to ground in the coil driver circuit\n NOTE: If the ignition coil driver signal wire is not open or shorted to voltage or ground and there is no trigger signal to the coil then suspect a faulty PCM coil driver. Also keep in mind that if the PCM driver is at fault, there may be a wiring problem that caused the PCM failure. It's a good idea to do the above check after PCM replacement to verify there won't be a repeat failure.

  "P0363": {
    "Meaning": "P0363 Misfire Detected - Fueling Disabled",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM monitors variations in the input signals from the crankshaft position sensor (CPS) and camshaft position sensor/s (CMPS) to determine if an ignition misfire is present, as well as which cylinder is misfiring. Initially, when an ignition misfire is detected, the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) may flash rapidly for a period of time and stop (instead of remaining illuminated). The purpose of the flashing MIL is to make the driver aware that current driving conditions, combined with a cylinder misfire, might lead to catalytic converter damage. Regardless of the flashing MIL, a misfire code should be stored; though it may be stored as a pending code.\nIn some vehicles (usually of the European variety), when the PCM detects several ignition cycles with a misfire code, it will disable fuel delivery to the affected cylinder. This is typically accomplished by disabling the ground pulse to the fuel injector for that particular cylinder. It is a good idea to discontinue fuel delivery to the particular cylinder because the excessive fuel can cause catalytic converter failure. However, for the novice technician it can also lead to confusion when testing. Learn more about the reason for that in the troubleshooting section.\nWhen an ignition misfire has been detected, a cylinder misfire code has been stored, and fuel delivery to the affected cylinder has been disabled, a code P0363 will be stored and a MIL may be illuminated. One or more cylinder misfire code/s usually accompany this code.\nOther misfire codes includ P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304, etc.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nA stored code P0363 is in reaction to one or more cylinder misfire code/s which should be treated as severe in nature.\nSymptoms of this code may include:\n\n Rough or choppy engine operation, especially under acceleration \n Diminished engine performance \n Other misfire related codes will likely be stored \n Flashing MIL is a possibility\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n\n Defective spark plug(s)\n Faulty ignition coil/s or coil pack(s)\n Moisture or oil in spark plug galley/s \n Cracked or torn spark plug wire(s) or spark plug boot(s) \n Bad fuel injector(s)\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nA diagnostic scanner and an accurate vehicle information source (like All Data DIY) will be required to diagnose a code P0363.\nSince a code P0363 is essentially a reaction to a stored cylinder misfire code, you will need to diagnose any stored cylinder misfire codes (P0301 through P0312) before attempting to diagnose this code. Although there are numerous tools designed to test ignition coil, spark plug, and fuel injector function, the simple method of swapping components between cylinders has proven effective for me for more years than I care to declare. This may not always be feasible with the fuel injectors but it works well with ignition coils and spark plugs, which fail far more regularly than fuel injectors. For more tips on diagnosing cylinder misfire codes, see the appropriate entry in OBD II Codes.\nYou will still need the scanner to retrieve stored codes and freeze frame data. The scanner is also used to clear codes after you have written them down for reference as the diagnostic process continues. Once you have accomplished these things, clear the codes and you are set to begin swapping components for testing purposes. Obviously, spark plugs will need to be replaced in sets if the vehicle in question is near the recommended replacement interval. Nevertheless, locate the malfunctioning part prior to performing any maintenance. When replacing an ignition coil for a particular cylinder, spark plug replacement is recommended (unless the spark plugs have been recently replaced). This will save you time in the long run.\nThe problem that creates a ton of confusion is that, when some technicians discover that there is no ground pulse to the injector for the cylinder in question, they treat it as a malfunction instead of a reaction (caused by the PCM) to an ignition misfire. This can have you chasing your tail if you are unfamiliar with the fuel disabling system used in some models.\nIf the P0363 is stored without any cylinder misfire codes, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error. \nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\n The P0363 code must be cleared before the ground pulse will be restored to the injector for the cylinder in question\nWhen using the swapping method to test spark plugs, use caution removing plugs from aluminum cylinder heads. The threads (in the aluminum) are very fragile and may be damaged if not allowed to cool properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2003 BMW 745i codes p0014, p0363,p1343, p1349, p1357, p1345, p1347Hi, I have all these codes and my engine is running very rough.

  "P0370": {
    "Meaning": "P0370 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM uses this information to determine one or more of the following: fuel injector control, ignition timing and misfire diagnostics. There are two basic types of engine positions sensors: Hall-Effect and permanent magnet.\nBoth types of sensors are triggered by a wheel or disc mounted close to the sensor. Typical wheel/disc mounting locations include the engine position, injection pump, harmonic balancer and distributor shaft. When triggered, the sensor produces a return signal which is sent back to the PCM. \n\n Hall-Effect crank position sensors have three wires: reference (power), signal, and ground. The sensor receives a reference voltage (usually 5-volts) from the PCM, and is triggered by a reluctor wheel. The sensor then sends a corresponding digital return signal back to the PCM.\nPermanent magnet (PM) sensors produce their own AC voltage based on their proximity to a rotating reluctor wheel. This voltage signal is sent back to the PCM where it is converted to a digital signal by an internal analog to digital converter.\n\nIn the codes outlined in this article, the \"A\" indicates the problem is with a portion of the system circuit, instead of a particular symptom or component.\nA code P0370 is set when the PCM detects a malfunction with the \"A\" \nengine position sensor signal.\nRelated timing reference signal A trouble codes include:\n\nP0371 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A Too Many Pulses\nP0372 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A Too Few Pulses\nP0373 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A Intermittent/Erratic Pulses\nP0374 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A No Pulses\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nThe severity of these codes is moderate to severe.  Symptoms of a P0370 engine code may include: \n Illuminate check engine light\nHard starting/no starting\nPoor engine performance\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this P0370 code include: \n Faulty sensor\nWiring problems\nReluctor wheel damage\nContaminated oil\nFaulty PCM\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nBegin by visually inspecting the engine position sensor and the corresponding wiring. Look for loose connections, damaged wiring, etc. If damage is found, repair as necessary, clear the code and see if it returns. Also, check the engine for any metal particulates that may affect sensor operation. \nNext, check for technical service bulletins (TSBs) regarding the issue. If nothing is found, move forward to step by step diagnosis of the system.\nThe following is a generalized procedure, as testing for this code varies between vehicles. To accurately test the system, you'll want to refer to the manufacture's diagnostic flow chart. Test procedures also depend on the type of sensor found in your vehicle. \nCheck the sensor\n Hall-Effect sensor: use a digital multimeter set to DC volts and a back-probe test lead to ensure the sensor is producing a signal voltage. Connect one meter lead to the sensor signal wire and the other to ground. Have an assistant rotate the engine by tapping the ignition key (don't start the engine); the voltage reading should fluctuate between 0 volts and reference voltage. If available, you can also use an oscilloscope to view the signal pulses while cranking the engine. \n Permanent magnet sensor: begin by checking the internal resistance of the sensor. Disconnect the sensor electrical connector and connect a digital multimeter set to ohms to each of the sensor terminals. The resistance should be approximately 500 to 1,200 ohms. Consult the factory repair information for the exact specification. If the resistance test is OK, you'll want to test the sensor performance. To do this, reconnect the sensor electrical connector. Then, connect a digital multimeter set to AC volts to the sensor electrical connector using back probe test leads. Since the sensor produces AC voltage, is doesn't matter which way the meter leads are connected. Have an assistant crank the engine; you should see a fluctuating voltage reading. \nOne thing to remember during sensor testing damaged or improperly aligned tone ring will prevent proper sensor operation. When in doubt, access the tone ring and inspect as needed.\nCheck the circuit\nit's a good idea to have the factory wiring diagram on hand to determine which wire is which, while performing these tests. \nHall-effect sensor:\n\n Check the ground side of the circuit: connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the ground terminal on the sensor connector and ground. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit on the ground side of the circuit, which needs to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.\n Check the reference voltage side of the circuit: with the ignition on, use a digital multimeter set to volts to check for reference from the PCM (typically 5 volts) at one of the three sensor terminals. If no reference signal is present, connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the reference voltage terminal on the sensor and the reference voltage terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.  Next, you'll want to check that there is 5-volts coming out of the PCM at the reference voltage terminal. If there is not a 5-volt reference from the PCM, the PCM is probably faulty.\nCheck the return signal side of the circuit: with the ignition off, use a digital multimeter set to ohms to check for continuity between the engine position sensor output terminal and the signal voltage terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. \n\nPermanent magnet sensor:\n\n Check the ground side of the circuit: connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the ground terminal on the SENSOR connector and ground.

    "Meaning": "P0371 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A Too Many Pulses",
    "Common Causes": "The PCM uses this information to determine one or more of the following: fuel injector control, ignition timing and misfire diagnostics. There are two basic types of engine positions sensors: Hall-Effect and permanent magnet.\nBoth types of sensors are triggered by a wheel or disc mounted close to the sensor. Typical wheel/disc mounting locations include the engine position, injection pump, harmonic balancer and distributor shaft. When triggered, the sensor produces a return signal which is sent back to the PCM. \n\n Hall-Effect crank position sensors have three wires: reference (power), signal, and ground. The sensor receives a reference voltage (usually 5-volts) from the PCM, and is triggered by a reluctor wheel. The sensor then sends a corresponding digital return signal back to the PCM.\nPermanent magnet (PM) sensors produce their own AC voltage based on their proximity to a rotating reluctor wheel. This voltage signal is sent back to the PCM where it is converted to a digital signal by an internal analog to digital converter.\n\nIn the codes outlined in this article, the \"A\" indicates the problem is with a portion of the system circuit, instead of a particular symptom or component.\nA code P0371 is set when the PCM detects the engine position sensor \"A\" is producing a signal with too many pulses. \nRelated timing reference signal A trouble codes include:\n\nP0370 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A Malfunction\nP0372 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A Too Few Pulses\nP0373 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A Intermittent/Erratic Pulses\nP0374 Timing Reference High Resolution Signal A No Pulses\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nThe severity of these codes is moderate to severe.  Symptoms of a P0371 engine code may include: \n Illuminate check engine light\nHard starting/no starting\nPoor engine performance\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this P0371 code include: \n Faulty sensor\nWiring problems\nReluctor wheel damage\nContaminated oil\nFaulty PCM\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nBegin by visually inspecting the engine position sensor and the corresponding wiring. Look for loose connections, damaged wiring, etc. If damage is found, repair as necessary, clear the code and see if it returns. Also, check the engine for any metal particulates that may affect sensor operation. \nNext, check for technical service bulletins (TSBs) regarding the issue. If nothing is found, move forward to step by step diagnosis of the system.\nThe following is a generalized procedure, as testing for this code varies between vehicles. To accurately test the system, you'll want to refer to the manufacture's diagnostic flow chart. Test procedures also depend on the type of sensor found in your vehicle. \nCheck the sensor\n Hall-Effect sensor: use a digital multimeter set to DC volts and a back-probe test lead to ensure the sensor is producing a signal voltage. Connect one meter lead to the sensor signal wire and the other to ground. Have an assistant rotate the engine by tapping the ignition key (don't start the engine); the voltage reading should fluctuate between 0 volts and reference voltage. If available, you can also use an oscilloscope to view the signal pulses while cranking the engine. \n Permanent magnet sensor: begin by checking the internal resistance of the sensor. Disconnect the sensor electrical connector and connect a digital multimeter set to ohms to each of the sensor terminals. The resistance should be approximately 500 to 1,200 ohms. Consult the factory repair information for the exact specification. If the resistance test is OK, you'll want to test the sensor performance. To do this, reconnect the sensor electrical connector. Then, connect a digital multimeter set to AC volts to the sensor electrical connector using back probe test leads. Since the sensor produces AC voltage, is doesn't matter which way the meter leads are connected. Have an assistant crank the engine; you should see a fluctuating voltage reading. \nOne thing to remember during sensor testing damaged or improperly aligned tone ring will prevent proper sensor operation. When in doubt, access the tone ring and inspect as needed.\nCheck the circuit\nit's a good idea to have the factory wiring diagram on hand to determine which wire is which, while performing these tests. \nHall-effect sensor:\n\n Check the ground side of the circuit: connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the ground terminal on the sensor connector and ground. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit on the ground side of the circuit, which needs to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.\n Check the reference voltage side of the circuit: with the ignition on, use a digital multimeter set to volts to check for reference from the PCM (typically 5 volts) at one of the three sensor terminals. If no reference signal is present, connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the reference voltage terminal on the sensor and the reference voltage terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.  Next, you'll want to check that there is 5-volts coming out of the PCM at the reference voltage terminal. If there is not a 5-volt reference from the PCM, the PCM is probably faulty.\nCheck the return signal side of the circuit: with the ignition off, use a digital multimeter set to ohms to check for continuity between the engine position sensor output terminal and the signal voltage terminal on the PCM.

If nothing is found, move forward to step by step diagnosis of the system.\nThe following is a generalized procedure, as testing for this code varies between vehicles. To accurately test the system, you'll want to refer to the manufacture's diagnostic flow chart. Test procedures also depend on the type of sensor found in your vehicle. \nCheck the sensor\n Hall-Effect sensor: use a digital multimeter set to DC volts and a back-probe test lead to ensure the sensor is producing a signal voltage. Connect one meter lead to the sensor signal wire and the other to ground. Have an assistant rotate the engine by tapping the ignition key (don't start the engine); the voltage reading should fluctuate between 0 volts and reference voltage. If available, you can also use an oscilloscope to view the signal pulses while cranking the engine. \n Permanent magnet sensor: begin by checking the internal resistance of the sensor. Disconnect the sensor electrical connector and connect a digital multimeter set to ohms to each of the sensor terminals. The resistance should be approximately 500 to 1,200 ohms. Consult the factory repair information for the exact specification. If the resistance test is OK, you'll want to test the sensor performance. To do this, reconnect the sensor electrical connector. Then, connect a digital multimeter set to AC volts to the sensor electrical connector using back probe test leads. Since the sensor produces AC voltage, is doesn't matter which way the meter leads are connected. Have an assistant crank the engine; you should see a fluctuating voltage reading. \nOne thing to remember during sensor testing damaged or improperly aligned tone ring will prevent proper sensor operation. When in doubt, access the tone ring and inspect as needed.\nCheck the circuit\nit's a good idea to have the factory wiring diagram on hand to determine which wire is which, while performing these tests. \nHall-effect sensor:\n\n Check the ground side of the circuit: connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the ground terminal on the sensor connector and ground. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit on the ground side of the circuit, which needs to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.\n Check the reference voltage side of the circuit: with the ignition on, use a digital multimeter set to volts to check for reference from the PCM (typically 5 volts) at one of the three sensor terminals. If no reference signal is present, connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the reference voltage terminal on the sensor and the reference voltage terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity.  Next, you'll want to check that there is 5-volts coming out of the PCM at the reference voltage terminal. If there is not a 5-volt reference from the PCM, the PCM is probably faulty.\nCheck the return signal side of the circuit: with the ignition off, use a digital multimeter set to ohms to check for continuity between the engine position sensor output terminal and the signal voltage terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. \n\nPermanent magnet sensor:\n\n Check the ground side of the circuit: connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the ground terminal on the SENSOR connector and ground.

Next, you'll want to check that there is 5-volts coming out of the PCM at the reference voltage terminal. If there is not a 5-volt reference from the PCM, the PCM is probably faulty.\nCheck the return signal side of the circuit: with the ignition off, use a digital multimeter set to ohms to check for continuity between the engine position sensor output terminal and the signal voltage terminal on the PCM. If the meter reads a numeric value, there is continuity. If the meter reads out of limits (OL) there is an open circuit between the PCM and sensor that will need to be located and repaired. \n\nPermanent magnet sensor:\n\n Check the ground side of the circuit: connect the meter set to ohms (with the ignition off) between the ground terminal on the SENSOR connector and ground.

  "P0381": {
    "Meaning": "P0381 Glow Plug/Heater Indicator Circuit Malfunction",
    "Common Causes": "High compression is used to cause fuel to combust in diesel engines. Since compression ratios are so extreme, diesel engine blocks are typically more dense and heavy than engine blocks of gasoline fueled engines. This can lead to reduced cylinder temperatures which make the diesel engine more difficult to start, especially during cold weather conditions. Since diesel engines generate combustion without spark, cylinder temperature is crucial to cold start efficiency.\nCylinder temperature is increased when voltage is applied to the glow plugs and they literally begin to glow red hot. Most OBD-II equipped vehicles use one glow plug per cylinder, but some applications use fewer plugs, placed strategically within the intake manifold or cylinder head. \nGlow plug heater voltage is normally controlled by the PCM but some vehicles are also equipped with a stand-alone glow plug heater controller. Others have a glow plug heater controller integrated within the PCM. The glow plug controller uses input signals from the engine coolant temperature sensor and the ambient air temperature sensor to calculate glow plug activation strategy. When the controller recognizes that conditions warrant glow plug activation, an output signal is sent to a glow plug timer relay which allows battery voltage to reach the glow plugs. Since the glow plugs are grounded by the engine block (or cylinder head) they become very hot and begin to glow when battery voltage is applied. Glow plug operation only takes place when the engine temperature is below a programmed temperature.\nA typical diesel engine glow plug:\n\nIncluded in the glow plug heater control circuit is the glow plug indicator. The glow plug indicator is an instrument panel integrated warning lamp that is illuminated when the glow plugs/heater are in operation. During cold start conditions, the glow plug indicator is typically illuminated after the ignition switch is turned to the ON position, and it goes off prior to starting the engine. This short period of time allows the energized glow plugs to heat the cylinders before attempting to start the engine. The glow plug indicator is designed to alert the driver that the glow plugs are in operation.\nIf the PCM detects a problem in the circuit that controls the glow plug/heater indicator, a P0381 will be stored and a malfunction indicator lamp may be illuminated.\nSeverity & Symptoms\nGlow plug operation will likely be disabled if a code P0381 is stored, therefore it should be considered a severe condition.\nSymptoms of a P0381 code may include:\n\n Delayed engine start up, especially during periods of extremely cold weather \n Excessive smoke from the exhaust \n No glow plug indicator illumination \n Constant glow plug indicator illumination\n\nCauses\nPossible causes for this engine code include:\n\n Defective glow plug indicator lamp bulb \n Faulty glow plug/heater relay\n Glow plug/heater controller malfunction\n Open or shorted glow plug/heater indicator circuit \n Bad instrument panel circuit board\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nA good starting point is always to check for technical service bulletins (TSB) for your particular vehicle. Your issue may be a known issue with a known fix put out by the manufacturer and can save you time and money during diagnosis.\nYou will need a scanner, a digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM), and a reputable vehicle information source (such as All Data DIY) to diagnose a code P0381.\nI usually begin my diagnosis with a visual inspection of all system related wiring and connectors. In this case, I would also test all fuses and fusible links that are related to the glow plugs/heater, gauges, and indicators.\nI would continue by connecting the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic connector to retrieve the stored codes and freeze frame data. I would write this information down. If this code proves to be intermittent, it may prove helpful. Next, I\u2019d clear the codes and operate the glow plug/heater to see if it is immediately reset. If the P0381 is reset, consult your vehicle information source for system relay design specifications. Use the DVOM to test system circuits and relays. Make repairs as needed and retest the system.\nIf the glow plug heater indicator fails to illuminate, suspect an open circuit, a faulty relay, or a bad glow plug timer controller.\nIf the glow plug heater indicator remains illuminated, suspect a shorted (to power) circuit or a faulty instrument panel circuit board.\nIf the glow plug indicator seems to operate normally and the P0381 continues to reset, suspect a defective glow plug or an open glow plug/heater circuit.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n\nAn easy method of testing glow plugs is to remove them from the engine, ground them, and apply 12-volts. If the glow plug begins to glow, it is functioning properly. If it does not, replace the glow plug\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nRenault Megane P0381 and P2263 \"Check Injection\" and Service light on when I hit 2700rpm.I have a Renault Megane on a 57 plate...it is a 1.5 DCi Dynamique 106....\nThe first time this fault showed on my dash was after overtaking in 4th gear and hitting around 3200rpm, Its since done it at around 2700rpm.

    "Common Causes": "The CKP sensor is stationary and works in harmony with a reluctor ring (or toothed ring) that is attached to the crankshaft.  As this reluctor ring passes in front of the CKP sensor, the magnetic field created by the CKP sensor is interrupted and this creates a square wave voltage signal that the PCM interprets as crankshaft position.  If the PCM detects that there are no crankshaft pulses or if it sees a problem with the pulses on the output circuit, P0385 will set. \nRelated crank position sensor B trouble codes:\n\nP0386 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Range/Performance\nP0387 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Low Input\nP0388 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit High Input\nP0389 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Intermittent\n\nSymptoms\nNOTE:  If the crank sensor is used only for misfire detection and NOT spark timing (this varies with the vehicle), the vehicle should start and run with MIL (Malfunction indicator lamp) illumination.  Also, some vehicles require several key cycles to illuminate the MIL.  If this is the case, there may be no MIL illumination until the problem often enough over time.  If the crank sensor is used for BOTH misfire detection and spark timing, the vehicle may or may not start.   Symptoms may include:\n\nVehicle may not start (see above)\nVehicle may run rough or misfire\nMIL illumination\n\nCauses\nA P0385 \"check engine light\" code could be caused by:\n\nDamaged CKP sensor connector\nDamaged reluctor ring (missing teeth or not turning due to sheared-off keyway)\nSensor output open\nSensor output shorted to ground\nSensor output shorted to voltage\nFailed crank sensor\nFailed PCM\n\nPossible Solutions\n\nUsing a scan tool, check if, when engine is running or cranking, that there is an RPM signal.\nIf there is no RPM reading, then visually inspect the crank Sensor Bnd connector for any damage and repair as necessary.  If there is no visible damage, and you have access to a scope, you could check the CKP 5 Volt square wave pattern.  If you do not, then, obtain a resistance reading of your crank sensor from a repair manual.  (There are so many different types of crank sensors that there's no way to put here which resistance reading is correct).  Then check the resistance of the CKP sensor by disconnecting the Sensor Bnd measuring resistance of the sensor.  (It is best to check resistance readings from the PCM connector.  This rules out any wiring problems from the start.  But it does require some mechanical skill and shouldn't be performed if you\\'re not familiar with automobile electrical systems).  Is the sensor within resistance specs?\n If not, replace the CKP sensor.  If so, recheck resistance reading from the PCM connector.  Is the reading still okay?\n If not, repair open or short in the wiring to the crank Sensor Bnd re-check.  If the reading is okay, the problem is intermittent or the PCM may be at fault.  Try reconnecting and checking for RPM signal again.  If there is now an RPM signal, wiggle test the wiring harness to try and induce the fault. \n\nThis code is basically identical to P0335. This code P0385 refers to Crankshaft Posistion Sensor \"B\", whereas P0335 refers to Crankshaft Position Sensor \"A\".

  "P0386": {
    "Meaning": "P0386 Crankshaft Position Sensor Range/Performance",
    "Common Causes": "As the reluctor wheel passes in front of the crank sensor, an A/C signal is produced that varies according to engine speed. The PCM (powertrain control module) uses this A/C signal to interpret engine RPM. Some crank sensors are hall-effect sensors instead of permanent magnent sensors. These are three wire sensors, provided with voltage, ground, and signal. They too have a reluctor wheel with vanes and \"windows\" that change the voltage signal to the PCM, providing a RPM signal. I will focus on the former, since they are simpler design and more common.\nThe crankshaft reluctor has a specific number of teeth and the PCM can determine the position of the crankshaft using only this sensor's signature pattern. The PCM uses this sensor to also determine cylinder misfires by measuring the reluctor teeth locations in the CKP sensor signal. In conjunction with the Camshaft position sensor (CMP) the PCM can determine timing of spark and fuel injection. If the PCM senses a loss of CKP sensor signal (RPM signal) even momentarily, P0386 may set.\nNote: This DTC refers to the \"B\" sensor.  Refer to a vehicle specific repair manual to confirm the location of your \"B\" crankshaft position sensor. In the case of some GM (Cadillac) engines, the \"B\" sensor is the upper while the \"A\" sensor is the lower, but check to be sure.

Try to reproduce the complaint. When engine stalls or if the engine will not start and continue to run, then crank engine while observing RPM reading. If there is no RPM reading, check for a signal coming out of the crank sensor. Using a scope is best, but since most DIYers don't have access to one you may be able to use a code reader or the tachometer to check for RPM signal.\nVisually check the CKP harness for damage or cracking in the wiring insulation. Repair as necessary. Make sure the wiring isn't mis-routed near high voltage spark plug wires. Check for loose connection or broken lock at the sensor connector. Repair as necessary. Obtain a resistance spec for the Crank sensor. Remove and check it. If it doesn't pass, replace it. If it checks out okay, check the reluctor ring for damage, broken teeth, or debris lodged in the ring. Make sure the reluctor ring isn't dislodged. It should be stationary on the crankshaft. Carefully repair/replace as necessary. Note: some reluctor rings are located in the bell housing of the transmission or behind the front engine cover and cannot be easily accessed.\nIf the vehicle intermittently stalls and after stalling you have no RPM signal and you have verified the wiring to the CKP sensor is good, then try replacing the sensor. If that doesn't take care of it, and you can't access the reluctor ring, seek help from an automotive professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\n2001 dadillac deville p0386 codeI have replaced both crank sensors twice and same problem.

  "P0387": {
    "Meaning": "P0387 Crankshaft Position Sensor B Circuit Low Input",
    "Common Causes": "CKP sensors are responsible for monitoring engine speed (RPM) and crankshaft position. Both of these factors are used in various engine management scenarios but are especially critical to ignition (spark) timing and fuel delivery.\nThe position of the crankshaft, particularly in relation to the camshaft/s, is one of the key factors used by the PCM to calculate ignition spark timing. The camshafts turn at half the speed of the crankshaft, so it is important that the PCM is able to distinguish between engine intake and exhaust stokes (rotations). The CKP sensor and each camshaft position (CMP) sensor have at least one circuit dedicated to providing the PCM with an input signal, a 5-volt reference signal, and a ground. \nCKP sensors are typically of the electro magnetic, hall-effect variety. They are mounted to the exterior of the engine in very close proximity (usually only several thousandths of an inch) to a circuit completing engine ground. This engine ground is usually a reluctor ring (with precisely machined teeth) affixed to one end of the crankshaft or integrated into the crankshaft itself.\nThe CKP sensor is mounted so that the crankshaft reluctor wheel passes very closely to its magnetic tip. As the crankshaft rotates, the raised areas (on the reluctor wheel) complete an electromagnetic circuit with the sensor. When the gaps between the teeth pass the CKP sensor, the circuit is briefly interrupted. The circuit interruptions create voltage fluctuations that the PCM perceives as a waveform pattern. \nWith the engine running, the PCM constantly compares input signals from the CKP and CMP sensors. If CKP input signal voltage is lower than expected under certain circumstances, a P0387 code will be stored and a MIL may be illuminated.\nOther crankshaft position sensor B trouble codes include P0385, P0386, P0388, and P0389.\n\nCode Severity & Symptoms\nWhen a P0387 is stored, the engine will not likely run and this code should be categorized as severe. Even if the engine will start and run, there is a high risk of a no start condition and there will be drivability repercussions. \nSymptoms of this code may include:\n The engine will not start\nThe tachometer (if equipped) does not register RPM when the engine is cranked\nHesitation upon acceleration\nPoor engine performance\nDiminished fuel efficiency\n\nCauses\nPotential causes for this code to set are:\n Defective CKP sensor\nOpen or shorted wiring to the CKP sensor\nCorroded or fluid soaked connector at the CKP sensor\nFaulty PCM or PCM programming error\n\nDiagnostic and Repair Procedures\nPrior to diagnosing a code P0387, I need to have access to a suitable diagnostic scanner, with an integrated digital volt/ohmmeter (DVOM) and oscilloscope. I will also need access to All Data DIY (as a reliable vehicle information source).\nA viable starting point for any code diagnosis is a visual inspection of system related wiring harnesses and connectors. Since petroleum based fluids compromise the protective insulation on wiring and lead to shorted or open circuits (and a stored P0387), circuits, electrical sensors, and/or connectors that have been contaminated with engine oil, coolant, or power steering fluid should be examined carefully. \nIf everything looks good, connect the scanner to the vehicle diagnostic port and retrieve all stored trouble codes and freeze frame data. I like writing this information down as it may help if the P0387 proves to be intermittent. \nTest voltage at the CKP sensor in question. A five-volt reference is typically used for CKP sensor operation but check manufacturer\u2019s specifications for the vehicle in question. There should also be a ground signal and one or more output circuits. If reference voltage and ground circuits are detected at the CKP sensor connector, proceed to the next step.\nAfter disconnecting the electrical connector from the CKP sensor in question, test it according to manufacturer\u2019s specifications, using the DVOM. If resistance levels in the CKP sensor fail to comply with manufacturer\u2019s specifications, replace it. If the CKP sensor does coincide with specs, continue to the next step. Reconnect the CKP sensor in question. Attach the positive test lead of the oscilloscope to the signal output wire and connect the negative lead to the sensor ground circuit. Now, power up the oscilloscope and select the appropriate voltage setting. With the engine running, observe the waveform pattern on the oscilloscope focusing on unexpected spikes or glitches. If spikes or glitches are observed, carefully wiggle the wiring harness and connector for the CKP sensor in question to determine whether the problem is a loose connection or a defective sensor. If missing voltage blocks are noticed in the waveform pattern, suspect either a broken or worn reluctor ring or that the magnetic tip of the CKP sensor has excessive metallic debris. If no problems are found in the waveform pattern, proceed to the next step.\nConnect the test leads of the oscilloscope to CKP sensor signal input and ground circuits near the PCM connector and observe the waveform pattern. If the waveform pattern near the PCM connector is dissimilar to what was seen when the test leads were connected near the CKP sensor, suspect an open or shorted circuit between the CKP sensor connector and the PCM connector. If this is the case, disconnect all related controllers and begin testing individual circuits with the DVOM. Shorted or open circuits must be repaired or replaced. If the waveform pattern is identical to what was seen when the test leads were connected near the CKP sensor, suspect a defective PCM or a PCM programming error.\nAdditional diagnostic notes:\n Some manufacturers recommend that CKP and CMP sensors are replaced as a set\nUse technical service bulletins to aid in the diagnostic process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated  DTC Discussions\n\nRegister now to ask a question (free)\n\nThere are currently no related topics in our forums.
